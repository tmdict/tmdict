A Mechanical Illusion Art where she produces a blade of vacuum, and after drawing the target(s) in, pulverizes them via air compression. Katou Danzou’s trump card. It is something that puts the genjutsu that swallowed up a bull, which was told in the “Hokuetsu Gundan”, to practical use. Because of the “Kashin Mystic Code” within her that Kashin Koji personally incorporated, it is endowed with a special attack property against demonic enemies. It is further feasible to utilize it as a genjutsu of “erasing bodies and objects before the people’s eyes” and “revealing erased bodies and objects before their eyes again” just like in the anecdotes.

When Danzou slices the flower and/or fruit held in her hand, somehow, the head of an enemy who was at a faraway distance falls off. A mysterious special move that is carried out by making use of a moonflower as described in the “Otogi Bouko” Kanazoushi and/or a bottle gourd as described in the “Hokuetsu Gundan” military science book. Danzou speaks of it as nothing more than a kind of genjutsu. It seems her true opinion is that she does not want to use it if possible as it is more than too much of a murder technique.
