### Oṃ Ālolik Svāhā: Mantra of the Holy Avalokiteśvara

Oṃ Ālolik Svāhā.
An anti-unit Noble Phantasm. It’s the manifestation of her regret and grief over not meeting her last moments together with Yoshinaka, combined with her natural flame and demon powers, and turned into a Noble Phantasm.
The Avalokiteśvara serves as the idol of the temple where her beloved Yoshinaka’s memorial services were held, and by saying its mantra she once again confirms her love towards Yoshinaka, after which she grabs and throws the enemy into the air and shoots a flaming arrow at them. The enemy then receives damage from the sun-shaped magic energy that symbolizes her feelings towards Yoshinaka.

### Namaḥ Samantavajrānāṃ Hāṃ: The Arrow of my Overflowing Feelings

Namaḥ Samantavajrānāṃ Hāṃ.
An arrow of death that leads to boiling, evaporating, and finally extinction.
She transforms her mana into heat, and shoots and arrow of flames towards her enemy. The arrow itself isn’t special (for something that’s shot at the speed of sound), but the flames give it more power.
It’s similar but different to Mana Burst. The fact that it can be used for long-range attacks is the biggest difference.
Tomoe tries to lie saying this abnormal power ‘Comes from the Shogun of Asahi, Yoshinaka-sama’s power’, but it is most likely due to her strong demon blood, and she could use it even in life.
In FGO there’s no activation through chanting its name, and Tomoe uses it in her regular attacks.
If she so wishes, she can even use the flames with her Naginata.
