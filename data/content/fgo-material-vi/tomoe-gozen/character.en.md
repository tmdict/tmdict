### Personality

Tomoe is both a gallant female warrior, as well as a ladylike girl who behaves like a good wife.
Since she is a mixed-race descendant of demon blood, she should be very prone to rampaging about, but due to her love towards Kiso no Yoshinaka she managed to seal that side of hers and obtained individuality as a calm human woman (or so she appears to be).

Outside of battle, she is a lady who quietly obeys her lord, although sometimes she will act in ways distant from human common sense. Even when given knowledge of the modern world thanks to the grail, she feels the information is too much as well as not being able to experience all of it herself.
However, once in the battlefield, she will stand with high spirits as a female warrior, her red eyes glowing as she tramples down the enemy forces.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Tomoe talks about Yoshinaka a lot, but she doesn’t wish for the grail to revive him.
Yoshinaka has already died.
Tomoe herself has already died.
The dead are the dead. They are not something that should be brought back to this world.
Tomoe’s opinion on life and death are very clear. Tomoe has no doubts that as a Servant, she is only a temporary existence which eventually should quietly disappear from this world. Even in the Babylonia chapter, she chose to sacrifice herself to defeat the enemy general Girtablilu.
Though secretly, just lightly…In some distant afterlife, she thinks about wanting to meet Yoshinaka once more. If possible, also with her son Asahina Yoshihide… (this is only a thought, not a wish).

The Tomoe summoned in Chaldea has decided that, as a Servant, she must watch over her new lord (Master) to the very end.

### Dialogue Examples

“I am Tomoe. I previously devoted myself to Yoshinaka-sama, but this time I shall serve you.”
“You wish to ask about Yoshinaka-sama?”
“Noriyori, Yoshitsune, and Yoritomo…If I were to see those people, I’m not confident that I’d be able to control myself. I fear that it’s likely…an Oni would appear there.”
“So what about you? Do you find the demon Tomoe terrifying?”
“Master and Yoshinaka-sama are…Different.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Dates of birth and death are unknown. She’s a person who lived through the late Heian and early Kamakura periods.
The concubine of the general Kiso no Yoshinaka, who was defeated by the great unifying shogun, Minamoto no Yoritomo.
A brave woman who always served Yoshinaka, and frequently distinguished herself in battle. She was formidable in battle, said to be as strong as a thousand men.
Daugther of Nakahara no Kanetoh, and younger sister of two of the Four Heavenly Kings of Kiso, Imai Kanehira and Higuchi Kanemitsu.

In the 9th volume of “The Tale of the Heike”, according to “The Death of Kiso” Tomoe is described as “with white skin, long hair and beautiful features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or god, mounted or on foot”.
Basically, white-skinned, long-haired, and a powerful archer beauty worth a thousand men. That is Tomoe Gozen.
There’s also a story of how she removed the powerful general Onda no Hachirou Moroshige’s head by twisting it and ripping it off his body.

In the year 1184 AD, she gained fame fighting a defensive battle together with Yoshinaka against Yoshitsune’s forces after these had received orders to attack from Yoritomo, but persuaded by Yoshinaka, Tomoe withdrew from the front lines. After that Yoshinaka lost his life and Tomoe escaped to Kiso.
According to the “Genpei Jōsuiki”, Tomoe then married to Wada Yoshimori and had her son Asahina Yoshihide, eventually she became a nun, but…if you take into account that, according to the Azuma Kagami, Yoshihide’s year of birth is 1176, this creates many contradictions, which leads to many rumors and theories saying Yoshihide is actually a son she had with Yoshinaka.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She’s a female warrior who, along with her ever continuint feelings towards her lord Yoshinaka, she also carries the regret of not being able to spend his last moments together.
This quiet sorrow of hers was turned into a flame of rage by Ashiya Douman in ‘The seven duels of the swordmaster heroic spirits’, and she became a monster of fire with the objective of burning down the Sagami region.
Usually she is a graceful maiden. She hates quarrels between people, and enjoys the beauty of nature.

Her red eyes may be proof of her being a mix of human with a now-extinct species of demon. She possesses a low-rank version of Mad Enhancenment even though she’s an Archer. She doesn’t lose any of her sanity, but some of her physical abilities are enhanced, allowing her to display a ferocious fighting style.

She likes games.
This includes both videogames and analog/board games.
It seems she is quite attracted to those involving battles.

In ‘The seven duels of the swordmaster heroic spirits’, she was one of the swordmaster heroic spirits summoned by the necromancer, and appeared as Archer Inferno, fighting the protagonist and Miyamoto Musashi.
The Tomoe summoned in Chaldea has no memories of this. She’s essentially a different person.

However, she’s aware of what happened in the pruned phenomenom of Shimousa after having read the records in Chaldea’s database. After having read it, she went around visiting everyone who had been involved in the singularity and, lowering her head in apology, told them “Even if that was a different incarnation of myself, it was still one with the same soul as mine. At that time, Inferno truly caused you a lot of trouble.”.
