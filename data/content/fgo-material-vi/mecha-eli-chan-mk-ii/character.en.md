### Personality

Mecha Eli-chan Mk.II
While Mk.I is more competent in the context of being a lord, this version is more competent in the context of being a “guardian diety”. She operates on the principles of gods rather than humans.
Her sensibility as lord, and the feeling that it is possible to come to an agreement through dialogue were lost, and so she single-mindedly acts as a merciless defense mechanism against humanity (foreign invaders).
Although the grotesque notion of bathing herself in the blood of maidens in order to maintain her beauty is no more, the sadism and cruelty has certainly been inherited.

A cool girl who hates being called Mecha Eli-chan and prefers to be referred to only as “Mk. II”. Looking down on humans, her motto is that they are merely decoration for the country (fiefdom) and should be controlled by force if they try to resist. …That being said, since she understands that reasoning of hers is not something good for the people, she will never claim to be a “good law”.
As an evil to humans, she treats the lives of the people as “something good” and controls it.
She is an evil Mecha Eli-chan with such a belief underneath the true face of misanthropy.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She is curious about what this human thinks about her, who chose to be of pure silver.
Mk.II doesn’t have a single doubt regarding her own beauty, but she recognizes that the human sense of aesthethics prefers multiple colors over just one.
Do they share the same sense of aesthetics as her own, or was she chosen on some other aesthetic basis?
Either way, it doesn’t matter to Mk.II
In this world, they alone are a rare existence.

### Dialogue Examples

“Osakabehime. I don’t have time to waste. Since you are the one in possession of the Holy Grail, I would like you to hurry up and be done with this.”
“…What a foolish man. The who will be sent flying is you. If you can’t feel the difference in power through your skin then I’ll teach you by crushing your bones. I am not as lenient as that Mk I who’s stuck on acting as an idealistic feudal lord. I shall teach you that the title of Mk II means I am twice as ruthless.”
“You prefer control that has been thoroughly enforced? In that case, that would be my field of expertise.”
“ I’ll silence the noisy pigs with live ammo.”
“Y-you’re telling me to purge my chest armoring..!? Just what’s going through that head of yours!? I am aware what you’re intent is since it is contained within my library. Still, for such a thing…you should choose a place with a better atmosphere to it…”
“Running wild is the beauty of mechas. On that alone, I won’t concede.”
“So you didn’t pick Mk I. I know it’s strange coming from me, but do you have a preference for strange articles? Or perhaps your tastes are just retro. …Fufu. Stu~pid.”

### Setting

“Dark gray is without doubt the superior color scheme. That is what a young woman should be like.
Now the true coldblooded, ruthless robot dragon descends!”

The other mysterious machine servant who appeared amidst the extreme turmoil of Halloween.
She resembles Mecha Eli-chan in appearance, has a matching Noble Phantasm, as well as identical skills and parameters.
What does this strange coincidence mean…?
Rumor has it that she is the smartest, and possesses the most heroine power among the Elizabeth species, but really---?

“A word of warning: I’ll kill you if you say konpachi”{{n1}}

She appeared in “Devil’s Building Climber: Great Decisive Battle at Himeji Castle.”
The true final boss revealed in the middle of the story.
The ruthless yet good-natured Mk. I was unable to see through Osakabehime’s real intentions and failed.
Meanwhile, Mk. II saw through Osakabehime’s true nature, yet did not feel righteous indignation. Instead she coolly set out to administrate Castle Čachtice and dominate over Halloween as a Servant.
To Mk. II, both Osakabehime and Chaldea are the same. Nothing more than “tools that came from the outside, who possess a Holy Grail”, which exist in order to perpetuate the Castle Čachtice.

Unlike the lord copy that is Mk. I, Mk. II was built only as a guardian statue. In a sense, she is the defense mechanism of the Castle Čachtice itself.
The megaframe (giant mecha) that appeared in the background of Himeji Castle is her main body, but because its magical energy consumption is colossal, it can only properly move its hands.
She appeared as a cool and cruel villain, but the end result is as you know.
At the end of the day, she is Elizabeth, and so she was willing to open her heart to the Master who was concerned about her. As usual, her (sub) heroine-power alone is high.

### Wish for the Holy Grail

To freely protect Čachtice Castle as an invincible guardian deity. Furthermore, she wants the Master to remain her pilot.

### Connections with Characters

#### Charles Babbage

The most beautiful. The eternal prince of special effects high society.
The journal “Periodical - Golem Correspondence, issue 19 - In the Name of Mathematics, you are innocent” is a must-have for Mk.II

#### Elizabeth Bathory

Although forever disqualified as a lord, there’s a sense of surprise and even a little happiness regarding the possibility of her becoming a kindhearted ruler, even if just for a while. She dreams of a time when she’ll be able to use that song as a supersonic weapon during a Final War.{{n2}}

#### Kingprotea

Since Protea calls herself a kaiju, she is inevitably a rival. She is competitive against mecha-type kaiju, and treats animal-type kaiju sadistically. To rain down missiles on a murky kaiju going “gao, gao” is the true desire of any mecha-type.

1. {{note1}} A japanese term used to refer to a character who borrows their design from another (hence having a “compatible design”), basically having the underhanded meaning of “knockoff”.
2. {{note2}} This is, obviously, also a reference to Godzilla: Final Wars.
