By opening the “Gate” that leads to a foreign space incompatible with humanity, severe distortions are generated within the target’s mind/body. A rhizome from the Qliphoth, the Tree of Evil, grows alongside that tree. The targets on which this could take effect are restricted to Abigail’s own recognition, as one who became the “Key”. It is an Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm because of that. Under normal circumstances, it should also be called an Anti-World Noble Phantasm, possessing a limitless nature in regard to the targets this effect could take root on.
