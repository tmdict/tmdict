Gáe Bolg Alternative.
Their shapes are similar, but as a matter of fact, this spear is something different from the spear that Cú Chulainn possesses. A specialized weapon of the same model that was put to use before, it is one-grade older in comparison to Gáe Bolg. There is not only one, but several of them.

For its ability at the time of releasing its True Name, it results in a special move similar to Cú Chulainn’s two Noble Phantasms, “Barbed Spear of the Piercing Death Thorn” and “Striking Spear of the Piercing Death Flight”, being combined together. First, for its close-range attack, a first demonic spear would snatch away the enemy’s freedom to move and act by “sewing them onto a space in the air”, and after that, she would throw with all her strength a second demonic spear to pierce through the enemy as the finishing blow. Naturally, enemies in the way of the thrown demonic spear will have their lives stolen away entirely as a result.

### Gate of Skye: Gate to the Haunted Ground Brimming with Death

Gate of Skye.
Temporarily summons an enormous “gate” that leads to the “Land of Shadows” located at the Outside of the World, a foreign region turned into a haunted ground, of which it was severed from the World. It completely sucks up all living things that are within the effect’s range to the domain under her rule, the “Land of Shadows”. Those who fail a Magical Power and Luck Check will be sucked into the “gate” and are instantly killed. A person not approved by Scáthach will not be permitted to enter the “Land of Shadows” as they are while they possess life. Even if one successfully resists the suction, they sustain great damage since their magical energy was rapidly drained.
