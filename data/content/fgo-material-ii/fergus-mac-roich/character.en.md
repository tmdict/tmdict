### Personality

Big-hearted. A man of broad-mindedness who does not care very much about trivial matters. Often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear. Sincere and humane. To a companion judged to be trustworthy, Fergus has the tolerance to show and share his heaps of generosity with that companion no matter what, even if it happens to be their first meeting. However, he never permits betrayal, and he will not forgive one who does it, even if they are a king. He always keeps the promises he exchanges.

In addition, on the occasion of the “Táin Bó Cúailnge”, referred to as the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle in Celtic Mythology, when Fergus and Cú Chulainn crossed blades in earnest, mostly every other Ulster men had completely ceased into inactivity already due to a curse, so with that being the case (as in the first place, this war itself was also something that began due to Queen Medb’s selfishness), during the time they clashed with each other, Fergus promised to Cú Chulainn that he will ease up to a degree in order to not go too far in killing his defenseless former allies, and he displayed to others the fulfillment of his promises sincerely.

Although he is known as Medb’s lover, Fergus has a legitimate wife too. Moreover, she is a goddess of the forest. Fergus usually wears a composed face, but frankly, there is a hidden peerlessness behind it. His sexual desire is excessively too full of vigour, so much that if it was the common woman, that aspect of his needed seven women in a single night to become satisfied, and it is said that only Medb and his wife “can either be, surprisingly enough, just that one person that was okay” for his satisfaction.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Fergus comes into contact with his Master as a “comrade-in-arms”. His awareness of the relationship between master and servant is very thin. He recognizes them as a comrade in the battle of the hunt for the Holy Grail, as well as a commanding officer that he should trust. If Cú Chulainn is “a reliable elder brother”, Fergus has numerous words and deeds typical of “a reliable uncle”.

The wish Fergus wants to make on the Holy Grail is “to once again “get along” with his wife and Medb together.” Get along. Together.{{n1}}

### Dialogue Examples

“Very well. It looks like you want to spill your blood!”
“There’s a pleasant moon, and a nice wind is blowing. And then, there’s you. The fact is, just you alone is who I can keep on living for.”
“Those who are brave warriors can eat well, drink well, and rest well at ease.”
“Oh. There’s a fine woman.”
“That’s a splendid Noble Phantasm! If that’s the case, let’s proceed with a match with my Rainbow Sword!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A brave warrior of the Celts/Ulster who is known as a member of the Red Branch Knights. The friend and foster father of Cú Chulainn. A great glutton who is viewed as one with matchless vigour{{n2}}, often generous, without jealousy, and knows no fear. Even now, the fame of the hero Fergus as a magnificent brave warrior is being left behind in posterity.

There is also a legend where Fergus was the King of Ulster from the previous generation. According to that, it is said he had temporarily handed over the throne to Conchobar under the condition that Conchobar’s beautiful mother was made into his lover, but Conchobar’s mother, who was overflowing with sinister designs, left Fergus out of the kingship permanently with those designs.

Fergus was formerly a man who established a corner of the Red Branch Knights, but he ran away from the order of knights out of rage at the betrayal of Ulster King Conchobar. During the time when the greatest war of the Ulster Cycle broke out, Fergus took the side of his lover, Queen Medb of Connacht, and displayed his valour. Because Cú Chulainn stayed with Ulster, Fergus was kept from demonstrating his true seriousness in battle, but he still had once reached the point where he was one breath away from slaying King Conchobar.

Due to the pledge (geis) exchanged with Cú Chulainn at the occasion of this battle, Fergus will almost unconditionally win against Cú Chulainn in the situation where a rematch is done with him. At the time of the second Ulster invasion, because Queen Medb was scheming her revenge against Cú Chulainn, she concluded that “Fergus’ existence will be a nuisance”, and she did not invite Fergus to the battlefield. Afterwards, Fergus was assassinated by the hands of a jealousy-driven King Ailill, Medb’s husband.

### Connections with Characters

#### Cú Chulainn

His adopted son and friend. If he sees Cú Chulainn, Fergus will slap his shoulder with great joy and roar with laughter.

#### Queen Medb

Lover. Mistress. A reunion would be a delight, the past is something to yearn for. And then, Fergus will decide to utter words like a filthy old man for a moment. Although Medb will strike back at ease with some leeway for him…

#### Scáthach

A peerlessly beautiful woman. Teacher. So, Fergus holds a thought of ‘Hey, I want to request you for the night’, but he understands that it is impossible.

#### Beautiful Female Servants

Fergus basically does not want to speak words and do deeds that will appear to disturb his position as the uncle who will become reliable for others, but towards adult women, the indication of “I want to request you as my companion for the night” is oozing. Given that children are targets of protection, he does not have much of an interest in those with an outward appearance of the very young-looking type.
