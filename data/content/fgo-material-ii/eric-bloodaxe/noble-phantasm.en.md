The dark red axe he usually brings alongside him. Something that was processed with the Magical Beast that he once defeated and made into an axe. Surprisingly, it seems that this Magical Beast that was made into this axe is still “living”, and it has been surviving by continuing to sip on blood, seeking blood as nourishment. If it is not given blood within a fixed time, it would starve and completely die. If that is the case, its power as a weapon would become a mere shadow of its former self, so periodic supplies of blood are needed.

It is Eric’s Madness Enhancement doping that was caused by the black mage, Gunnhild. He charges into the enemies and minces them without even caring about the likes of the damage being caused by himself. Of course, he also gets injured by the damage caused by himself in its own way. The realization of the anecdote where he slain altogether his own close relatives and made his self-introduction as the Norwegian King. Although it is not an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm, it is a Noble Phantasm suitable for fighting multiple opponents. However, even the damage he accumulated on the occasion of his return from the bloodbath will be just as severe. It would probably be better for him to refrain from using this Noble Phantasm if he does not have the means to recover as he is now.
