Durindana, it is the Italian reading of “Durandal”. Namely, Hector is the original owner of “The Ultimate Unbreakable Hallow” Noble Phantasm that was in Roland’s possession. Because there are no holy relics located inside its hilt, it is limited to being a simple Noble Phantasm that merely causes a large amount of damage…

The javelin (pilum) said to have been used by Hector, piercing and separating from all things it strikes. That is, it is nothing but him extending the handle of the sword on occasions and throwing it as a spear. Although he cannot use both the sword and the spear simultaneously, even if he is summoned as either a Lancer or a Saber, he will always possess both the sword and the spear Noble Phantasms. To defend against this thrown spear, one must prepare a defensive Noble Phantasm that is at least equivalent to “Rho Aias”.

Also, both True Names of the two forms are strictly called “Durindana”, so even if the second half of the names are omitted, it is possible to activate them as Noble Phantasms.
