A famous torture tool said to have been used by Elizabeth Báthory… Although, as a result of an investigation that spanned over a long period of time, investigators had come to the conclusion that it did not exist. Nonetheless, there are many who believe in the existence of this torture device, so it has been esteemed as an exquisite Noble Phantasm that kills innocent maidens while they are filled with fear.

Floating above Carmilla’s head, screams of the target are heard while the iron maiden is filled with their blood the moment it closes shut. It is a recovery of health and an attack being used together. In the case of female Servants, damage increases.
