The slingshot that defeated the giant Goliath. The five stones that express David’s tolerance, he fires the first four shots and misses his opponent on purpose as a warning, but the fifth shot will surely hit a vital point. In the case of a Servant, they will temporarily lose consciousness and suffer severe damage, although it is something insignificant even in a typical war situation where the unconscious person can be rescued by allies. Afterwards, the opponent’s main armament will either become a part of David’s possessions, or it will become unusable. He will yell in the Hebrew language a countdown of “He (5)”, “Dalet (4)”, “Gimel (3)”, “Bet (2)” and “Alef (1)” before launching the fifth stone. He will make the threat obvious towards his opponent from the count of one with a stronger shout. Given that the weapons themselves are mere normal stones that have undergone transfiguration, it is possible to unendingly replenish them.

Phantasmal incense burners would materialize around each enemy presence, before they would burn the incense inside them, causing violet fumes to envelop the targets. Immediately, thunderclouds and mist gather overhead, giving somebody the impression of Mount Sinai, and hellfire is sent down from the heavens, thoroughly incinerating those who oppose the will of God without even leaving a single drop of blood behind. The flames as a whole take on the form of an altar.

A wooden box that stored the lithographs left behind by Moses. The magical energy of those who touched it will be stolen without exception, no ifs, ands, or buts, leading them to their extinguishment.
