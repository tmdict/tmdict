### Mind’s Eye (Fake): A

Resistance against corrections{{n1}} caused by vision obstructions.
It can be also be defined as a sixth sense or premonition{{n2}}; sensing danger by means of natural talent.

### Vitrification: B+{{n3}}

Serene and clear, as a polished mirror and still water. A mental defense that invalidates mental interference.
While he may not be an assassin in the traditional sense and thus unable to make use of the Assassin’s ability of “Presence Concealment”, he is able to conceal his presence utilizing a martial artist’s state of empty mind{{n4}}.

### Knowledge of Sowa: B{{n5}}

A special technical skill which prevents the degradation of accuracy regardless how many times the same technique has been used against the same enemy.
His attacks becomes imperceivable.{{n6}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} As in DnD style dice roll probability correction
2. {{note2}} 虫の知らせ. Random trivia: it’s a jp ancient concept that there is a bug living inside you that has various effects on your emotion and consciousness. [More info here](http://gogen-allguide.com/mu/mushinoshirase.html).
3. {{note3}} 透化 is actually a legitimate scientific term for when things went under excessive cooling after a fusion process, turning into glass-shaped amorphous substance. Hence, vitrification.
4. {{note4}} An add on info from CM3 for Vitrification and Presence Concealment D: “Since he is not a true Servant Assassin, this is not a class ability. It is his intrinsic ability as a martial artist to “cut off his presence”. This is not a skill to hide, but a technique of the mind for the martial artist to merge with his surroundings.”
  So basically,
  - Not a true servant assassin
  - Doesn’t have PC
  - But have Vitrification
  - Uses Vitri to have martial PC rank D innate skill instead of class skill
  
  That is, Kojiro’s PC was not a result of his class, but by Vitrification.
5. {{note5}} 宗和 is a weird concept. Like, I cant find actual encyclopedic entry of that term, only a tea ceremony style which is a stretch. However, individually the kanji 宗 means principle/center/pillar/meaning, whereas 和 is an actual concept, which translates best into Harmony. It implies a peaceful unity and conformity within a social group, in which members prefer the continuation of a harmonious community over their personal interests.
6. {{note6}} Add on info from game: “Perhaps, it was such a sword mastery that other’s simply cannot become accustomed to it.”
