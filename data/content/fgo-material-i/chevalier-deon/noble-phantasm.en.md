Fleur-de-Lis.

A beautiful sword dance that charms the beholder. D’Éon’s way of life where they continued to accomplish their objectives while many men and women were led astray by them has been sublimated into this Noble Phantasm.

Within the lily petals – which symbolizes the French Royal Authority – that are scattering into the surroundings, by vividly dancing while wielding their sword, d’Éon fascinates their target, causing the target’s Strength/Constitution/Agility parameters to be lowered, and d’Éon drives a deadly sword thrust into their target during that opening. A mental attack + physical attack combination. The physical damage only occurs once at the time of the Noble Phantasm’s invocation, but the fascination status persists for a while longer. Magical energy consumption is also low, so it is an extremely easy-to-use Noble Phantasm.

Fleur-de-Lis.

Beautiful sword dance version 2 that charms the beholders. Its reading is the same as “~that Scatters Lily Petals”. D’Éon’s way of life where they continued to accomplish their objectives while many men and women were led astray by them has been sublimated into this Noble Phantasm. This is the enhanced version.

This sword dance causes a fully bloomed lily, which symbolizes the French Royal Authority, to rise to the surface, fascinating the enemy camp all at once and causing the targets’ Strength/Constitution/Agility parameters to be lowered for a while. Furthermore, if they do not succeed in their Luck Checks, they will become unable to act for a period of 1 turn. There is no damage effect for this version.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} D’Éon has a 3rd version of his/her Noble Phantasm. As seen in Agartha, it’s called “Fleur-de-Lis: Profusion of a Hundred Flowers that Flutters Lily Petals”, which is a more potent version of their 2nd Noble Phantasm. It’s a hidden Noble Phantasm that, by releasing all the magical energy in their body, causes lilies to dance for however long d’Éon wishes them to in order to fascinate their enemies. Compared to their 2nd Noble Phantasm’s maximum number of targets being fifty people, this version can target a hundred or even a thousand people, creating just enough dancing lilies to potentially affect everyone in an enemy camp regardless of their number.
