One of Charlemagne’s Twelve Paladins and a virtuous female knight, also known as the “White Feathered Knight,” she was a princess born to the king’s younger sister Beatrice and Duke Aymon of the House Clermont. Her older brother Rinaldo, wielder of the demonic sword Fusberta, was another of the Twelve Paladins. Like her brother, she is renowned as a master swordsman.

When Charlemagne’s army was forced to retreat in the deadly battle against the great King Agramante, Bradamante willingly placed herself in the rearguard, where she engaged in a spectacular duel with the King of Algiers, Rodomonte.
