72 demon gods, assembled as one.
After King Solomon’s death, the 72 demons who were sealed within his corpse awoke to a unique ideology, took Solomon’s name for themselves, and set about on their task to convert the entire human race to energy. From their perspective, they became the true Mage King Solomon. 

The 72 demon gods were originally a system created by the human Solomon, the founder of magecraft, to “efficiently advance reason in the correct direction.”
They came to resent the relationship between King Solomon and humans, and became a curse that attempted to overcome the “human imperfection” that Solomon had ignored for so long.

Its name is Goetia, the system for the Incineration of Humanity.
A sentient magecraft woven to reach true wisdom, and to use all of human history to reach the beginning of all.
