Most likely the model for the figure…the Phantom that appeared in the novel “The Phantom of the Opera” that took place in the 19th century.
Living in the vast labyrinth of aqueducts beneath the opera house, he was attracted to a young actress and helped her become a diva.
But he committed a series of murders, so his love could never come to fruition.
