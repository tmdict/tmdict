Yíng Zhèng, otherwise known as Qin Shi Huang. The first emperor of China, who unified the nation in 221 BC. This “True Body” is Qin Shi Huang of the Chinese Lostbelt.

Wielding absolute authority through a completely centralized government, the emperor was dedicated to domestic rule and technological development, all while pursuing the way of the sage in an attempt to continuously extend the emperor’s own natural lifespan. The Zhēnrén form is the final outcome of those experiments.
