One of the Knights of the Round Table from the Legend of King Arthur.
He is one of the oldest and most loyal knights serving under the King, staying with her until the very end.
He wields the holy sword of the sun, said to be the sister sword of Excalibur.
And thanks to the blessings of a saint, he won fame as a peerless knight who was unmatched under the light of sun.
