A 19th century female occultist and the founder of Theosophy.
She married a Russian noble at a young age, but immediately ran away to make herself known in the world of magecraft. Commonly known as Madame Blavatsky.
She believed in the existence of the lost continent of Lemuria, and devoted herself to the study of the Mystics. She made contact with higher-dimensional beings known as the “Mahatmas,” and their collective body “Hierarchy,” gaining much wisdom in the process.
Perhaps she has seen for herself the possibilities of reaching the Root.
