Charlotte Corday was the woman who assassinated the prominent leader of the Jacobins, Jean-Paul Marat, during the French Revolution.
Her lovely appearance, paired with the fact that she planned and executed the assassination both efficiently and all on her own, earned her the nickname “the angel of assassination.”
