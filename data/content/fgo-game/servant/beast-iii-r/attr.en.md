Beast III/R.
A new type of heaven or deity calling itself the Freely Joyous, Third Outer Thought Pleasure of Heaven, that has taken form as one of the Evils of Humanity in FGO.

The true boss in Fate/EXTRA CCC.
In that iteration, she used BB to fuse with Mooncell and transformed into a true devil.
The horns growing from her head are diabolical. In other words, they signify that she is the antagonist of the Enlightened One.
