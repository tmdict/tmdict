A woman seen in the Irregular Singularity, Boundary Formula.
Clad in a luxurious kimono, her gestures are graceful and her judgment is merciful.
All are considered to be significantly normal in an abnormal world.
As her existence itself is uncertain, despite knowing about numerous bizarre incidents, she takes no part in them.

A woman you’d never meet under normal circumstances.
Even so…if an encounter were at all possible, it would be on a snowy night, after everyone had gone to sleep.
