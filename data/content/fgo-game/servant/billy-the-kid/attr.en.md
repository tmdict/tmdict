Billy the Kid. Real name William Henry McCarty Junior.
One of the most famous outlaws of the American Wild West, he remains popular to this day.
He was so famous that a photograph of him went for 2.3 million dollars at auction.
His father is unknown, but his mother gave him a good education.
His letters, which remain with us to this day, are very well-written for a Wild West outlaw.
