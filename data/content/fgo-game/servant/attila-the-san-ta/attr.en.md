Look up at the sky.
Anyone making a wish on the holy night should be able to see it…
A rainbow streaks across the night sky, and a flock of sheep can be heard crying, “Baa.”
Dressed in a…bold outfit, this adorable Santa has caught a little cold…

Her name is Attila the San(ta).
The Magister Militum of the West and sword princess who possesses the Crest of the Star has, after an admittedly peculiar quirk of fate, awakened to the role of Santa Claus. Though she is suffering her first ever bout of sickness (a mild fever), she is determined to be the reliable third Heroic Spirit of Christmas!

This time around, in accordance with the stories that made her famous, she commands an army of nomadic cavalry.
…At least, that was the idea. Somehow she ended up with an army of cute space-sheep. We don’t get it, either…
