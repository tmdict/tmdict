The young Queen of ancient Britannia in the 1st century.
Unable to forgive the Roman Empire after their vicious invasion which disgraced herself and her daughters, she rallied the kings into a rebellion, but ultimately lost her life when Emperor Nero’s army crushed them.
Later, she became known as the “Queen of Victory.”
She is one of Britain’s many legends.
