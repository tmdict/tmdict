The Mesopotamian goddess of beauty, fertility, and war.
She was said to be the most loved (read: spoiled) by the gods.
In this form she has not manifested as the goddess Ishtar, but as a pseudo-Servant with the body of a human with a similar wavelength to her own as a vessel.
She says that her role is to watch over humanity, like a goddess should. By this, she means she likes to grin to herself as she watches and say, “Now, is humanity going to survive? Or is it going to go extinct, I wonder?”
She truly is the (red) devil of Venus.
