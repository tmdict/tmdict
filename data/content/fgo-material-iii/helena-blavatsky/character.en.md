### Personality

An eternal magical girl who is kind to others, and yet strict to herself. During her lifetime, Helena wandered from place to place throughout many high societies, having networked with geniuses endowed with a strong individuality such as Edison and Bell, and she occasionally argued with authoritarians and the Mage’s Association in every direction, having excelled at mediating these sort of things. If she is in a place where many Servants congregate, Helena’s nature is also probably reflected as that of a “meddlesome elder sister/mother who is helpful in taking care of people.”

However, one should not forget that Helena herself is also still a genius endowed with a strong self-assertion. Towards a “mediocre person” who does not understand the concepts of Mahatma and Hierarchy, it seems that they will not particularly attract her interest, but in the case where she recognized for a moment that they “have promise” in understanding those concepts, she will probably not let her target get away easily.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

It appears————Helena has many wishes she would like to make on the Holy Grail. She says that she cannot narrow them down to one, but it is unknown what is actually the case.

“As for a very mysterious woman, don’t you think that’s nice? Errr, that’s not it. There’s only one truth, which the people can’t perceive: Everything is known by Mahatma!”

### Dialogue Examples

“————Excellent. This Caster will guide you!”
”I’ll teach you anything you want. Old things, new things, I completely comprehend them all!”
“That time when we barbequed, I wonder whyyy you child prodigies didn’t learn your lesson. No matter how old you grow to be, you’re still children huh? Although, I don’t even dislike that sort of thing————”
“Lemuria in the sea! Hierarchy in the heavens! And me on the Earth!”
“… Yes? Me during my lifetime? I was in this form all the way until I died. What of it?”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. A female occultist of the 19th Century, a founder of Theosophy. One of the leaders in modern occultism. Although she married a Russian aristocrat at a young age, she would immediately elope to live gorgeously in the magic world. Popularly known as Madame Blavatsky. Immersing herself in mysticism out of belief of the existence of the Lemurian continent that was said to be a land erased in the ancient times, she came in contact with a higher existence, “Mahatma”, and its collective body, “Hierarchy”, having acquired an abundant amount of wisdom in the process————If that is surely the case, it may not be known that she might have caught sight of a possibility towards the Root.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A prodigious mage born as a mutation. She called the pioneers who have reached the Root as “Mahatma” and “Hierarchy”, and stipulated (assumed) that they are higher existences. Helena herself says that she always felt their messages, but for others to feel the same things, it seems that the same kind of ability (special Magical Circuits) she possesses is needed. It is highly likely that neither the Lemurian continent nor Mahatma actually exists, and she is “merely a prodigy who performed a peculiar interpretation of the world.” Up to her last moments, she could not reach an agreement with London’s Mage’s Association.

As a Servant, Helena materializes as an all-rounder Caster who manipulates many magecrafts, from the ancient times to the modern era, that became a foundation for Theosophy. Although she can show that she can even so far as manipulate the Ancient Egyptian Magics and the Holy Church’s Baptism Rites, it seems that those ancient ones are not really her forte as expected.

### General Armaments

She can perform magical attacks by means of incantations. She can also perform distant magical attacks not by using attributes such as fire and wind, but by projecting pure magical energy. Specifically, a book (secret doctrine) floats around and fires beams with a ‘bang!’

### Connections with Characters

#### Edison and Nikola Tesla

Helena is on good terms with Edison like how it was before when they had a networking connection with each other during their lifetimes. Regarding the relationship between Edison and Nikola Tesla and their eternal rivalry, her comment from an elder sister’s point of view is this: “Good grief, even after they became Heroic Spirits…”

#### Nursery Rhyme

At any rate, because she remembers “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” when she looks at Nursery Rhyme, Helena has mixed feelings. If she says it plainly, it is not a pleasant feeling. For that is because Lewis Carroll, aka Charles Dodgson, the author of “Alice”, was a supporter of the SPR (The United Kingdom’s Society of Psychical Research). As a Heroic Spirit, Helena Blavatsky happens to go into the relatively calmer group of people, but she cannot get used to being kind to those authoritarians who chased after her during her lifetime. Regarding this matter, she says “I still loathe them.”

#### Arthur Conan Doyle

Although Sir Conan Doyle was a supporter of the SPR, concerning him, his reaction to Helena was somewhat kind.

“Although Mr. Doyle is by no means a bad person, he… was a person involved with the SPR, wasn’t he?… Um, of course? I understand that Mr. Holmes isn’t bad, right?”

#### Indian Heroic Spirits

To Helena, India is her second home… or rather, it is even like the home of her soul. She wants to do something like getting along with them.
