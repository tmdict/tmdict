### Shén Qiāng Wú Èr Dǎ: God Spear No Second Strike

A technical skill that reached up to the point of sublimation as a Noble Phantasm, similarly to “No Second Strike” or “Tsubame Gaeshi”. Its effects are the same as “No Second Strike” during his time of being summoned as an Assassin, but its range has been extended in proportion to the spear he holds. From the anecdote of him having “pierced the flies perched on the wall without scratching the wall”, one can guess that his precise movements are also not very different from when he fights bare-handed.
