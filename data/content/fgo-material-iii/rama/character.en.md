### Personality

Although he has a somewhat haughty section for his personality, Rama is basically a young boy who keeps up his efforts daily and is probably a splendid being as a “great king”. He is gentle to his subordinates and animals, further doing things such as curing squirrels with healing spells and helping others in making a bridge.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Regarding his Master, Rama will consider them as “a person who joined forces with him.” Naturally, he will not allow his Master to treat him as someone of a lower rank, but he will put his trust in them as a brethren to the very end.

Regarding the Holy Grail, Rama’s wish is “to undo his Curse of Separation from his wife Sita”, but up to the present time, that wish has not yet been granted.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Saber. I am Rama, the Great King of Kosala. Now that I have been summoned, I will certainly defeat any enemy, no matter how formidable they are, and I will give victory to you.”
“I understand, it is my loss… Surely, I… am like a child, you know… Yeah, so guide me. If it is the Master’s words, I will have faith in them and risk my life… Let us go!”
“If you are here, I… would be fine with that alone…!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The protagonist of the “Ramayana”, one of the two major epic poems in India.

Ravana, who could enslave even the gods due to a power he acquired by deceiving a great god, was a Demon King famed for the fact that only humans had the qualifications to defeat him.

Granting the appeals of the gods, Vishnu reincarnated as Rama, born as the imperial prince of a certain country, an ordinary human who had forgotten about everything.

Rama was naturally wise, but he was expelled from his country due to a scheme; borrowing and receiving powers from the sages and the gods, Rama tried to take back Sita, his beloved queen, from the hands of Demon King Ravana.

But even someone unique such as Rama had committed a fatal blunder. Intervening into a fight between fellow monkeys to rescue his ally monkey, Sugriva, he performed a sneak attack on the enemy monkey, Vali. Unable to forgive that, Vali’s wife placed a curse on him.

“Even if you are able to take back your queen, you will never share joy together with her again.”

That curse still continues on even after Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. It has been arranged so that Rama, the reincarnation of the god Vishnu, will continue to pass by Sita, his beloved queen, for all his life. The day the two can cuddle close together is when they must take back their original forms and ascend to the heavens.

But on the other hand, that also meant eternal separation from Sita until then. Though she was recaptured from the hands of Ravana that one time, it has been decided that Sita would leave Rama’s side during that moment as the nation’s people voiced suspicions of her being unfaithful to him.

Simultaneously. When Rama is being summoned, it has been decided so that the circumstances of this curse, at the time of being summoned by the Holy Grail, will have “Sita” be summoned instead as a different side of Rama. That is to say, it is also a sign that even being summoned due to the Holy Grail will not be able to make the two stand side-by-side.

Rama is primarily not a Saber, and it would be more proper to summon him as an Archer. As far as he is concerned, it is because Brahmastra is an arrow that eliminates all things demonic. However, an exemplary anecdote that has to do with Sita is her bow (her Noble Phantasm is “Haradhanu Janaka: Peerless Bow of Reminiscence”), so considering the likelihood that she would be summoned, Sita could not be a Saber; thus, Rama takes that Class instead so that Sita can get the Class of Archer.

… But then, since the Saber Class happens to be famed as the most superior of all the Classes, it may not be known that it was inevitable for Rama to choose this Class because being a young boy, he would try to put on a show for Sita.
