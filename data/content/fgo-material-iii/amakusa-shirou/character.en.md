### Personality

An amiable and mild young man, although he is philosophical to a peculiar degree and his actions can appear strangely caculating. Rather than building tough walls, he is the type to maintain his relations with others on a knife’s edge, keeping them neither friend nor foe. If anyone could draw close to him, it would be one who would accept his beliefs and wield its power.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He maintains a very modest relationship with his Master. As long as they do not accept his desires for the Holy Grail, the Master remains a target for purging no matter how friendly their relationship becomes. But if – only if – his Master assented to his views, and Amakusa Shirou himself recognized his Master as worthy of entrusting with his dream, then would he gladly offer his own life.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant Ruler, Amakusa Shirou Tokisada. Do I resemble someone else? A mere coincidence.”
“Oppression, domination, slaughter. I feel nothing but abhorrence for such things.”
“Oh…? No, it is nothing. The holy maiden and I may have different views of the world, but it is certain that she wishes for peace as well.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Amakusa Shirou Tokisada is the young man who served as the leader of Edo era’s greatest uprising, the Shimabara Rebellion. At the time, the Shimabara’s peasants had been suffering from heavy taxation levied by Shimahara’s daimyo, the clan of Matsukura. THe merciless land tax collection had been more than twice the crop yield, caused by sloppy land survey.

Not only that, other taxes such as the poll tax was implemented by the daimyo to squeeze out even more tax from the peasants, and finally, they revolted--------opening the curtain for the greatest insurrection in the Edo period that aimed to eradicate the Bakumatsu, the Shimabara Rebellion.

During the rebellion, there existed a certain spiritual leader.
For the persecuted Christians, he was the child of miracle.
He was likened to a holy man; walking above the sea, healing wounds, able to control birds.[1]
Deeds no men are capable of doing, miracles that only a saint allowed to perform.
His name was Amakusa Shirou Tokisada.

It was unknown how much command this young man had during the rebellion.
However, one way or another it was beyond doubt that his position had been in the summit, or infinitely close to it.

……I heard the voice of heaven, he had uttered.
In which case, the blessed young man had believed. Explaining it would have been too difficult, yet there had been no need for it.
Those who revere him as their leader would abide by those words and fight.

--------Maybe he had been too greedy. Or perhaps everything had gone too smoothly.

Or perhaps it was due to his words of “If I alone am killed, then perhaps this rebellion would end peacefully” being denied, and everything was pushed to the idea that the Edo shogunate must be opposed.

The Shimahara Rebellion then led towards the only tragic way it could; it was reported that the the massacre includes the besieged 37000 member of the rebellion (there are various theories.)
Amakusa Shirou Tokisada was then decapitated.

……The wish of the Amakusa Shirou Tokisada as a Servant is the salvation of mankind.
It had nothing to do with good or evil; each and every mankind is a target of salvation.
For that, he would bear even the long time of 60 years.

With the Human Order Incineration currently imminent, as of now he kept that wish of his to himself, and yet---------------
