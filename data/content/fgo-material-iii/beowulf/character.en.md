### Personality

As a king, Beowulf governed over his people well, but his current stance is fundamentally closer to a terrorist’s. At this time, he understands that there is a coin where creation and destruction are but two sides of that coin, and he recites that from the aftermath of destruction surely comes the stepping stone for creation.

He is a capable person that might be generally unfit for kingship, and Beowulf himself even generally shares that sentiment. His longing for destruction being greater than any other king, and his savagery which allowed him to accomplish even dragon slaying, did not change in the end even as he further grew old. However, he is kind to the people and to women, to those that are weak.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Beowulf basically comes across his Master as an equal or as a partner with a slightly lower rank than them. There may be a time where he listens to their opinions, and there may be a time where he does not listen to them. However, given that it is hard to say he is an intellectual one, he would comparatively be ready to jump onto reckless gambles, risking his life to accomplish the mission assigned to him. He has no desire for the Holy Grail. Nevertheless, he has the spirit to respond to his Master with all his power, seeing that he is being depended upon.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, Berserker. I responded to your summons… What kind of fucking face is that? Is it strange if a Berserker spoke?”
“What. These sharp-minded fellows are usually like heroes, yet they’re no more than a lot that are messed up in the head too. My work is to knock the shittier bastards among them the fuck out.”
“When you spend your life as a hero, you’ll definitely come across those guys. Those guys have a habit of finding it bothersome to think despite being able to resolve the problems by themselves, clinging and saying “Help!” instead. So, I’ll reply with this… “Shut up. Do what must be done.””
“Things like kingship, they were generally unsuitable jobs for me. I will not do them again.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Beowulf is the protagonist of “Beowulf”, said to be the oldest epic poem of English literature. The setting of the epic poem consists of the south side of modern Sweden to the vicinity of modern Denmark.

This tale is composed in two parts: part one is the story about Beowulf proceeding to exterminate the giant Grendel together with fifteen of his subordinates, while part two takes place fifty years later, depicting an aged Beowulf unfolding a mortal combat with a fire-breathing dragon.

The Scylding clan’s chief, Hrothgar, built a hall with the name of Heorot (meaning Hart, a male deer), and he held a banquet every evening of every day to celebrate it. However, the giant Grendel, irritated by the great noises of the celebrations, attacked Heorot, having slaughtered the Scylding clan’s men every evening.

————After twelve years, one warrior under Hrothgar took along with him fifteen of his subordinates and visited Heorot. That warrior’s name is Beowulf. He stayed at Heorot as Hrothgar and the others evacuated, and Beowulf would fight his opponent – Grendel, who came around late at night – unarmed, tearing off one of his arms and forcing the giant to retreat back to his lair.

Even though it was a moment that gave everyone a peace of mind, Grendel’s mother soon came to kidnap one of Hrothgar’s subordinates, snatching away and keeping Grendel’s torn arm for herself as she did so. Beowulf chased after Grendel’s mother to her lair and decapitated both the heads of Grendel’s mother and Grendel.

A delighted Hrothgar gave Beowulf gold and silver treasures, but the disinterested Beowulf returned to his country after receiving the treasures to present those to his lord, Hygelac, and serve him just as how it was before. That disinterest was not only towards his allies, but also to King Hygelac, and Beowulf became a target of ridicule because of Hygelac; however, Beowulf paid no heed to that.

Fifty years later, Beowulf became king. However, a fire dragon, who got angry about its treasures being stolen, attacked the country Beowulf was governing, and the people fell into disorder.

Unavoidably, Beowulf, in his aged body, spurred on in the direction of the dragon to exterminate it. His subordinates became scared and did not come along with him, and only one person, merely a young man named Wiglaf, accompanied him. Beowulf killed the fire dragon at the end of a fierce fight, but he also died due to the dragon’s poison. His last request to Wiglaf was for him to “use the treasures for the sake of the people”, the treasures buried in Earnanæs (Whale Cape).

Although the etymology of Berserker is the word Berserk from Norse Mythology, it has been told that the name Beowulf also has its origins in the word Berserk.

Contrary to the image of his outward appearance, this great king was someone dependable in governing his country, and moreover, was indeed respectable as a king who reigned without having his selfish desires run in the way of his kingship. Beowulf himself was truly apathetic to the monarchy, but it seems that he was best suited to be in the role of king with that nature of his. His figure doing battle while gambling his life for the sake of the people, even though they said that the man was unfit to be a king as such, was something no doubt fitting for a hero’s.

Unfortunately, the episodes of Beowulf, with the exception of the episodes of Grendel’s extermination and the dragon’s extermination that still remains, has been lost, but there is no doubt that these episodes became the source of numerous legends scattered throughout the world.

“Not only does that person uses other people’s Noble Phantasms for his own convenience, his method of using them is also clever. I’m quite pleased, even though I’m unable to stomach such a thing! The next time I see that guy, I’ll punch him!”
