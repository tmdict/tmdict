### Hrunting: Hound of the Red Plains

… A magic sword that can sniff out the smell of blood, it can launch the most optimal slash with a mere ordinary swing. Each time it lands a successful hit, the drawn blood will flow into the sword blade and it will shine in a red colour, becoming stronger. There is nothing flashy like an Anti-Army beam, but at any rate, it is a magic sword that can overbearingly decide the match when it is also coupled with his physical strength as a Berserker.

### Naegling: Iron Hammer Snake Smash

… A sword somewhat shorter than Hrunting. Rather than saying it is a sword, it is closer to a club made of steel, basically a sword serving the purpose of smashing up the target, and it is equivalent to having no cutting ability. Furthermore, there is a concern that it can be destroyed when it is used more than a certain number of times. However, at the moment of destruction, it can cause a large amount of damage to the target.

### Grendel Buster: Primal Conflict

A special Noble Phantasm that is banned from being used, but its ban can be lifted with the destruction of Hrunting and Naegling. The concept of bringing down Grendel becoming a Noble Phantasm. This Noble Phantasm temporarily restores the amazing physical strength he had during his lifetime, before he crushes the target from right in front of them by throwing, kicking and punching them. In addition, because these attacks are the same primitive form of weaponry (one’s own limbs) that has been unchanged since the primeval times, it negates Noble Phantasms and Skills that possess the characteristic of “grasping and perceiving every attack after seeing them used once.”
