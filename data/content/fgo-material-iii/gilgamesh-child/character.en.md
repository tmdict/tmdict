### Personality

‘His nature is cruel and heartless. A tyrant who does not comply with the people’s opinions and treats only his own standards as absolute’————such disposition does not hold true for Gilgamesh in this form. He, who has materialized with the figure of a boy’s, strongly possesses the mentality from around the time when he was called a wise ruler in the past, and he basically behaves as a polite and modest boy. The women he has a liking for are of a type similar to “flowers that bloom in the fields.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Gilgamesh might be prone to attaining even a fragment of the truth regarding the demise of human history. Still, he does not speak of anything about it. Rather, he is only watching over the Master’s battles and smiling. It seems he is not reluctant to lend even his support in the likes of combat, but even so, he will merely not talk about anything that concerns the “truth”————

### Dialogue Examples

“What to call me… That’s right, please casually call me, Gil.”
“Please think of me as just a child, and also, please tell me anything you want me to do, ok Master?”
“Not too simple, nor too showy. Hey, do you think making around this much adjustments is the most different aspect about me?”
“Wouldn’t it be better to do the things that should be done before long?”
“Growing up, huh?… Say, I have mixed feelings about that…”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Uruk’s Hero King. Mankind’s oldest hero. The demihuman, demigod king who governed the Sumerian city-state Uruk around the 26th Century BC. Kid Gil is completely the same person as the Heroic Spirit of the same name.

It is not certain in “Fate/Grand Order” whether Kid Gil is truly “Gilgamesh” – the one who materialized with his usual appearance – who became much younger by eating the wonder drug of rejuvenation, or whether he truly materialized with this figure from a much younger stage of his life since the beginning.

### General Armaments

Kid Gil shoots magic swords by means of his Noble Phantasm “Treasures of the King”; shooting attacks. The quantity of the contents that can be shot out is lower in comparison to what Gilgamesh in his normal state would have. The shooting is done not with the majestic style where both of his arms are usually crossed, but with a relaxed style where he clearly stands still.
