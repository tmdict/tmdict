A miracle drug that transforms his existence into Hyde from Jekyll, and into Jekyll from Hyde. When he is Hyde, he acquires close-combat power that can even overwhelm the Three Knight Classes. That transformed nature is close to a Berserker’s. It is an elixir refined through pharmacy and alchemy, as well as from some accidental results similar to degradation done over time; an item that is impossible to reproduce with modern science, technology and magic.
