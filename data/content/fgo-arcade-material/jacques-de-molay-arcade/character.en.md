### Personality

He is serious and shy. At first impression, he seems to have a communicative disorder and is terribly vulnerable. However, when it comes time to negotiate, this all changes, and he demonstrates a tenacious and strong mentality. As his health deteriorates, his sharpness of argument increases, and he is able to put his opponents to the test without backing down. He stubbornly adheres to the Templar oaths of “Death Rather Than Surrender” and “Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience. Since the Knights Templar’s vaults are the property of God, he is very dry when it comes to money. He is very careful to make deals that will not cause him any loss, not allowing his feelings to get in the way. He is prone to vomiting due to stomach problems, and when that happens he thinks of cute things.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

His wishes for the Holy Grail are the “Reclamation of the Holy Land” and the “Revival of the Knights Templar”. He submits to the Master with complete trust and tries to treat others fairly and modestly.

### Dialogue Examples

“Saber. Jacques de Molay at your call. Aha…… Please call me Molay, a pleasure to make your acquaintance……”
“Order! (control thyself)” “Time to pay up!” “A necessary business expense.”
“How much? What is the value you place on your life.” “Well, Master is the one who always throws off my assessment.”
“The shield of my cross is the shield of faith. My oath unbreakable! A solid foundation that can never be cracked…… well, uhhh…… maybe we need to consider the possibility I waver.”
“There is no such thing as gold heavier than life. Life itself is an unlimited wealth. The oath of our Templar knights is the light that protects the pilgrims———. ……That’s great and all but can I get back what I lent you?”
“Defeated as a knight, broken as a friar, and disgraced as Grand Master, I have done nothing. I was reduced to ashes without accomplishing anything, and I will make up for it here and now!”
“Pèlerinage du Temple! (Such a Long Pilgrimage)”
“Sheep…… are cute, aren’t they? That creature is really a sheep, 100% an unadulterated sheep. Ah…… what a miracle.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

The Knights Templar is a knightly order that protects pilgrims to the Holy City of Jerusalem. Molay is famous as its 23rd President and last Grand Master. King Philip IV, who wanted the vast assets of the Knights, accused Molay of heresy. The Knights were abolished. Molay was burned at the stake in Paris, leaving behind a curse.
13th century. Born at that time as a child of a small aristocrat in Molay, Burgundy, which belonged to the Holy Roman Empire.
Molay, who joined the Knights Templar at the age of 21 and became a knight, participated in the defense of the city of Acre, which was his last base, but the city fell without receiving the reinforcements of the Crusades.
Although the Knights’ headquarters was moved to Cyprus, Molay did not give up on the recapture of the Holy Land and burned his passion for the Crusades’ re-expedition, advocating the reform of the Knights, which had been corrupt and proud, and became Grand Master.

The Knights Templar has earned enormous wealth through donations from the feudal lords of each country, and has increased its assets by engaging in range of financial services, a forerunner of the modern banking industry, and had more than 10,000 large and small territories throughout Europe and owned property comparable to a kingdom. It can be said that Molay, in his position as Grand Master, would be similar to the President of a modern bank

Molay tried to be a devout monk as corruption was spreading throughout the Knights who had lost sight of their purpose. He regretted his unsuccessful military achievements and sought to recapture the Holy Land of Jerusalem.

The ominous day when the Knights Templar were arrested en masse after being falsely accused of heresy such as black magic and devil worship by King Philip IV of France is said to be the origin of the so-called “Friday the 13th”. After being imprisoned, tortured, and burned at the stake, Moray cursed Philip IV and his puppet Pope Clement V. In fact, within a year, both of them died.

### Character Image in “FGOAC”

Jacques de Molay, manifested as a Saber, is a pious monk. A Servant based on a historical perspective, after the Knights Templar were cleared of the stigma of heresy that had been unfairly imposed on them for centuries. Although he placed a curse on them as he burnt at the stake Molay manifested as a Servant has pity but no hatred for the French Royal Family who eventually declined.
However I want the money I loaned out to be returned. That is all.

Moley, the guardian of the gates of the religious city of Lost Jerusalem, was infected by the contaminated Holy Grail and possessed by complete madness. He stripped the bodies of the people seeking and offered their souls to the Demon Beast. Molay faced off against Chaldea but even though his core was shattered he kept his base and continued fighting, was defeated and disappeared alongside the Demon Beast.

### General Armaments

Long Sword, Cross Shield and Sheep.

### Connections with Characters

#### Richard the Lionheart

King Richard I, who commanded at the forefront of the 3rd Crusade, the valiant King of England! The first battle of the campaign was fought in Akon and Cyprus, both of which were marked by the passion of the Lionheart King. However, at the end of his expedition, he never set foot in the holy city of Jerusalem, even though the city was within sight at last. Was it because he did not want to be defenseless in front of his arch-enemy?… Or was it because he regretted not having achieved the desired results in the war? I have often thought about his regret and pride as a king……

#### Guardian Knight Georgius

Saint George, the famous dragon slaying Guardian Knight. Ah! We were both summoned to the same Dust Singularity. Even though we swore to false oaths and were both under the influence of the Book of Madness….we still stood on the long road of pilgrimage and fought together, and I consider it an honor. Please forgive my rudeness

#### Jacques de Molay (Foreigner)

What if a version of me corrupted by the evil attribute were to manifest? I can’t say that it will never happen. Everyone runs the risk of falling into temptation and falling from grace. However that is not something that can directly observed. As long as I’m myself if there is even a sliver of conscience left in me you have to tighten it up strictly and without mercy.
