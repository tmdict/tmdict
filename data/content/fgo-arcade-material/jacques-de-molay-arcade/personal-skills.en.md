### Oath of the Chivalric Order: A
“Death Rather Than Surrender” “Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience” The Sacred Oath of the Knights Templar which a young Molay took to with hope in his heart and never forgot as he lived.

### Recommended Almsgiving: A

A powerful business negotiation tactic that preached the noble mission of the Chivalric Order to the Feudal Lords of Europe and encouraged them to donate their assets. At times calm and gentle, at times forceful and coercive.

### Guardian of the Pilgrimage: B

The pride of the Knights Templar as those who sacrifice themselves to serve God and protect the faithful and their beliefs. The pride of Molay, who tried to fulfill his duty as the last Grand Master with utmost sincerity.
