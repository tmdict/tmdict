### Territory Creation: D

One can create a “Workshop”, which is an advantageous position for themselves as a Mage.

Perhaps due to being a completely rootless person and having a freewheeling activity plan of not staying at any one place, Merlin has not accumulated much experience in creating a Territory as such.

### High-Speed Incantation: EX

The ability to hasten the chants of magical incantations.

Although they are not Divine Words, the beauty of those Magic Words that Merlin speaks with has already reached the level of the Fairy Language. It is said that Merlin’s Magic Words are spoken in a fast and brief way, and have a sad sound to them in some respects.

### Tool Creation: A+

One can create devices tinged with Magical Energy.

The staff Merlin holds in that hand of hers is a Workshop, which is able to create various tools in the blink of an eye.

### Mixed-Blood: EX

One has the blood of a non-human being mixed in.

Merlin is considered to be a mixed-race being between an incubus and a human, and has completely inherited the special characteristics of a succubus.

### Independent Manifestation: A

A Skill to materialize into the present world as an individual entity.

Merlin has acquired this Skill through her own efforts and is using it for the sake of her own personal hobby. This is one of the reasons how she could appear in “this place” of which she has originally no connection to.

Naturally, Merlin cannot be summoned as a Heroic Spirit. This is because she has not even died in any kind of future. Her serving the Master as a Servant is her letting out her personal desire, or if said more frankly, it is her hobby. In order to make that hobby be realized, she acquired this Skill – which is unable to be possessed by anyone except by those from a certain unique Class – with her own efforts, and she is pretending to be someone who was summoned as a Servant.
