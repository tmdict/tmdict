I did not try to aim for a 3D design of Proto Merlin as I certainly did not believe she would be implemented into Arcade, but since there are more elements I was able to include into her design by not considering the 3D side of it, I think it turned out nicely in the end, did it not?… The reason why her 3rd Ascension’s appearance and earrings were overall made to look like elf ears was because my objective was to try to make her design into a Fairy-like image. I was conscious of using a design line different from Merlin’s for the sake of expressing approximately the same amount of difference shown between Artoria and Proto Arthur, but the composition of their colours felt generally similar, so I did things such as decreasing the shade just a little bit as I wanted more of a Proto impression from her.
