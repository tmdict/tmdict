### Hero Creation: B

The techniques to artificially give birth to and foster a “King”.

Merlin is one of the world-leading kingmakers, but because of her disposition of “The larger picture is important of course, but it’s even more important to have fun”, the Rank has fallen.

### Dreamlike Charisma: D

The ability to attract people.

It is also possible to say that it is a Skill that is indispensable for Kings and leaders, but for some reason, Merlin has it by nature… However, because Merlin throws the King’s life out of kilter now and then without meaning to, all for “the precedence of having fun”, her Charisma towards people has declined.

### Succubus’ Vicinity: EX

Merlin’s powers as the last succubus on Earth. It is also her real nature. It is a Skill that has the “Illusion Techniques” and “Mystic Eyes” Skills combined. With no more than a single sweep of her eyes over the battlefield, she interferes with the minds of enemies and allies collectively, and absorbs their Magical Energy at the same time.
