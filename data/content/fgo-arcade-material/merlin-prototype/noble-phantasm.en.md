Perhaps due to the kind of travels she made, this Merlin is not imprisoned in the Tower of Avalon.

(The theory that is most convincing is that Merlin was not caught in Morgan’s trap because she is a woman.)
(Another theory is that Merlin could have simply withdrew to paradise, but for all that said, she could be looking on human society from paradise in a carefree manner as it is not necessarily the case where she has anything to do in this world, or————)

Avalon will continue to exist until the moment humanity comes to its end. Merlin perceives Avalon in the form of “a future that is regarded as ideal, of which humanity aims for”. For that reason, the Avalon she inhabits is not shut off, and it becomes something placed as an open goal for humanity to reach.

Merlin’s staff points to beyond the horizon. It is “hope” itself that continues to shine the way ahead of eternity, and that continues to make every person move forward even now.
