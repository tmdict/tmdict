### Personality

A sweet flower who never loses her composure. Merlin perceives everything objectively, and despite analyzing the human world as something ugly, she will show to others that she will speak with hope, saying “Come now, it’s not necessary for everything to be pretty. No matter what kind of filthy things there are, it’s fine as long as there’s just one shining star somewhere.”

Merlin likes the world of humans, mischief, and young men. The Mage of Flowers eludes almost all things with a gentle smile while saying “C’mon.”

Differing from the male Merlin, this female Merlin maintains a satisfied mental structure of not having even any sort of worries. She is aware that she is a foreign substance in human society, and she completely reasons out that “Others are others, and I am me” as she does not particularly lament that.
“So I’m something like a navigator that was given birth by humanity, you understand? Therefore I have no intention of stepping into that circle.”
“I’m simply… a woman who believes to some degree that… it’s alright if your journeys never come to an end for eternity. You might say though that… if a journey is likely to become too boring, it’ll get me to slip in a finger… just for a little while.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Merlin deals with the Master with a smiling face and is gentle to them to some extent. Nevertheless, she maintains a moderate sense of distance, being neither too close nor too distant. The reason is because she is aware that the Master is a human and she is a foreign substance. And yet in the case that the time comes where she senses a “shining star” within the Master’s figure, then perhaps…?

### Dialogue Examples

Another Mage of Flowers who came from a different world. A woman who is like a sweet flower, Merlin never forgets her smile, no matter what the scenario is. Because of that beauty, anyone who is in front of her will forget about reality and lose sight of their hostility. On the other hand, she can sometimes be made out to be an enchantress who seduces men by being too beautiful (and by being too good at seduction).

Because of her composed behaviour and manner of talking, there are even times where Merlin is relied upon as a wise person, but because of having that lack of tension to her and a thinking that is too dry, she can sometimes be spoken ill of as a cold-blooded Mage who has no concern for the world of humans.

“Now, now. Don’t fret so much, and don’t grieve so much either. Whatever the case, the fact is that you’re all living creatures that will die in vain like birds. Though one would say, “All’s well that ends well”, right? Ah, no, I don’t want to see things that have ended or remain unfinished however, among other things.”

### Combat Style

Differing from the male Merlin, this female Merlin will not hold a sword in her hand to fight. She fights purely by means of using Magecraft through her staff, and by making use of “light (bits)” that are in a form similar to small Fairies. In addition, as she is nimble, she further carries out (something similar to) hand-to-hand combat actively.

### Connections with Characters

#### Arthur Pendragon

“Look, I’ve finally arrived, My Lord. Eh? What? You say that I’ll be stirring things up again as if I find that funny? Now that’s heartless of you, because even though I may seem like this, the fact is that I’ve been making great efforts for this and that.”
“… You’re right though.” (Whispering)

#### Tiamat

“Yo Tiamat. Everyone’s mother! Thank you, thank you for that time. I know. I wonder if I should go on at my own leisure now and then. Alright, I’ll treat you to dinner.”

#### Draco

“… Yo, I was imagining what kind of face you’re gonna make when you were summoned, but yeah. It’s a nice face. Ah, hey, I mean that in a good way of course. Since I’m nooot unkind to that extent, right? By the way, your… Class is Alter Ego, huh? Uh, nope? Come now, there’s no deeper meaning to it. Ahaha.”

#### Beast VI

“The fact is that the way we met was sad, even pitiful, and nothing more than the worst possible thing.”————Come now, I didn’t think of such things at all. I surely believe that, most of all, it was the best possible meeting between her and us. Even if it was something that happened at the very end, don’t you think? Especially since… that was for all of you, humanity!”
