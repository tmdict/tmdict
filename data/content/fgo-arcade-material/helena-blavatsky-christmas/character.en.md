### Personality

An eternal magical girl who is kind to others, yet strict to herself.

During her lifetime, she navigated numerous social circles and interacted with geniuses like Edison and Bell, known for their strong personalities. She often clashed with authoritarians and members of the Mage’s Association, showcasing her exceptional skills in mediation. In gatherings of many Servants, she might come across as a “caring older sister/mother” due to her nurturing nature. However, it’s important to remember that she herself is a genius with a strong sense of self. She tends to show little interest in “ordinary people” who do not understand the concepts of Mahatma or Hierarchy, but once she recognizes someone as promising, she is unlikely to let them go.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She claims to have many wishes she would like to make on the Holy Grail and can’t narrow it down to just one. The truth of this statement is unclear.

“Don’t you think it’s good to be a woman of many mysteries? No, I mean, yes. There is only one truth, it is beyond human understanding, and the Mahatma knows all!”

### Dialogue Examples

“Merry Christmas! С Рождеством!”{{n1}}
“Here I am, for I’ve arrived! With a Mahatma change, I’ve dressed up as Snegurochka! Rider, Helena Blavatsky. Now, let’s deliver gifts to the children!”
“Imitation Bartitsu!”

### Character Image in “FGOAC”

“Then I’ll be Snegurochka this year!” So declared Helena Blavatsky, splendidly changing her spiritual foundation with a Mahatma Change. While one might think this makes her Santa Helena Blavatsky, she is actually dressed in blue, not the traditional red attire of Santa. In Russia, there is “Ded Moroz,” a Santa-like figure in blue clothing, and his granddaughter “Snegurochka,” who also wears blue. Thus, Helena’s current form is not a Santa costume, nor is it a Russian Santa costume, but rather the attire of the daughter of a Russian Santa-like figure!

“С Рождеством! Here we go. Gifts for the good children! And gifts for the naughty ones too!”

### General Armaments

Hand to hand combat (a Mahatma arrangement of the Baritsu she learned from Holmes) + a mix of beam attacks from Santa Olcott.

### Connections with Characters

#### Child Servants

“Good child? Naughty child? It’s time for presents!”

#### Servants with Childlike Bodies but Mature Minds

“You seem like a naughty child, but I can’t help it. Here’s a present!”

#### Sherlock Holmes

“Oh come on, Sigerson! If only you had worn a blue outfit, we could’ve been Ded Moroz and Snegurochka!”

#### Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla

“Both of you are in blue! What a shame, Mr. Edison and Mr. Tesla!”

1. {{note1}} “С Рождеством!” is “Merry Christmas!” but in Russian.
