### Personality

About the same as the app version.

However in the Arcade World she is pretending to be the god of love (for the time being).

She still doesn’t want to work but she doesn’t show it openly instead saying “it’s for your love” with a smile meant to deceive.

It’s like the app version of Kama on her best behavior.

Her style is that of an angel of love (but with an ulterior motive).

When working, her goal is, in most cases, to quietly drag the subject to depravity.

Of course, her true nature remains the same, a girl full of bitterness, weariness, and immorality. She is a woman who is not assertive, but does not recognize any of her partner’s claims or rights and although she is pure she is also lewd greedy and ruthless. She is an evil woman who becomes as cruel as possible for the sake of love.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Since she ended up in a different Chaldea, she has no particular wish for the Holy Grail.

I’ve already made my way here so there’s nothing to be done and I’m lucky my true character hasn’t been exposed (?).
She pretends to be a proper god of love (angel of love) skips work as much as possible and tries to corrupt this Master of Chaldea, who has the same face, out of spite.

However, because their intimacy level increased so easily, Kama started blushing and acting suspiciously, saying, “What’s this…?”

### Dialogue Examples

“Are you asking about compatibility with that person? Seems fine, not that I would know.”
“You’re special, Master. Do you have someone you like? Just ask me and I’ll arrange everything for you. Even if you don’t do anything, I will help you fall into the happiness of passionate desire and…… lustful depravity.”
“Let the god of love draw you in. Give in to the sweet and dangerous fervor beating in the depths of your heart. Kama Sammohana! Fufu, let me corrupt you…”
“I am the God of Love. Love is the greatest! I am the God of love. Love is the greatest! …… Phew, that finishes up today’s practice. It can’t be helped, but having to do this every day hurts my brain……”

### Character Image in “FGOAC”

After a certain incident, Kama was asked to cooperate as a Servant, but when she was summoned, she found herself in a slightly different Chaldea than the one she had planned to go to.

“Huh? Did I take a wrong turn?”
The clumsy Kama has done it again.

After being summoned she meets the Master. “A Master of Chaldea is a Master of Chaldea they might be a bit different but shall I corrupt them too” she giggles to herself.

Fortunately, she was in the Archer class, where her other side, that of the Demon King had not been revealed. So she decided to play the role of an angel of love (laughs) for the time being waiting for an opportunity to corrupt them.

However due to Kama having weak defenses her plans were immediately exposed. The Master soon understood that she was just that kind of girl and began to look at her warmly while turning a blind eye.
