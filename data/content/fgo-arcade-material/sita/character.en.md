### Personality

A graceful and patient girl who continues to love Rama wholeheartedly.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She remains affectionate towards Master, serving them like a vassal to a king, but keeps her distance from romantic feelings.

Perhaps due to the long time she spent as a hostage, she is extremely patient. But when it comes to Rama, she loses herself.

### Dialogue Examples

### Historical Image · Character Image

Rama’s wife.

Due to a curse placed on Rama by the monkeys they were doomed to eternal separation. After 14 years Rama defeated the demon king Ravana and was reunited with Sita but their happiness didn’t last long.

Twice Sita’s chastity was doubted by the people and to clear her name she returned to the heavens as Lakshmi.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Sita is said to be an incarnation of Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi, and also said to be an incarnation of one of Vishnu’s split halves (the other half being Rama).

For that reason, when summoned in a Holy Grail War, Sita is granted the power of another version of Rama. Sita, knowing very well that she was only endowed with all of Rama’s Archer abilities due to their Curse of Separation, overcomes her fears and consents to fight.

### Connections with Characters

#### Rama

Two people who pleaged eternal love to each other. They are both imperfect so together they reached perfection. But now that they’re eternally separated by a curse that perfection will never be realized.

That being said Sita isn’t really the type to give up, as such ever since being summoned she’s tried every method including exchanging letters, magecraft aided communication and online meetings. She is absolutely confident that if Rama is summoned she’d be able to get in touch with him.
