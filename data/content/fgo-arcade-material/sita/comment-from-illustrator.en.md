Hello everyone Kususaga here! Rama’s dearly, dearly beloved Sita has been implemented in a truly demonic manner huh…? Do the management not have human hearts? (Happy!) I mean I feel sorry for her but it’s making me excited (You’re the true demon!). Anyway to see Sita giggling and jiggling (not like that!) in 3D it’s like…. it made that cute design worth it. I was simply so moved that I ended up crying. It’s like “Even a demon like you had tears to shed huh?” I mean it’s not like I’m a pervert who just draws urine! Well I am a pervert who just draws urine but still! Nine years ago I boasted that “Sita’s design is a once in a decade masterpiece” but I shudder to think that it’ll soon be ten years since I said that. Well… will I be able to draw another masterpiece…? Look forward to ten years from now! (That’ll make it twenty years you know!?) (Kususaga Rin)
