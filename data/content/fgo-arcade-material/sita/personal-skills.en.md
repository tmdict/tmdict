### Jewel of the Earth: A

From the story that she appeared from the tip of her father’s spade, because he prayed to gods when he was plowing a field. She’s loved and protected by the earth.

### Pilgrim of the Trial of Flames: B

From the story that Sita threw herself into a fire when pressed to prove that she didn’t have any intercourse with the enemy when she was a prisoner. Sure enough she wasn’t burnt by the flames.

### Curse of Separation: EX

A curse placed on Sita after her husband killed a monkey named Bali. As a result she is eternally unable to meet her husband Rama. They’ll only be free of the curse after they’ve abandoned their bodies. Sita herself isn’t cursed but Rama’s curse affects her.

### Core of the Goddess: C

Rama, a virtuous man greater than heroes, is an incarnation of one of the three great Indian gods Vinshu. One theory holds that Sita is another incarnation of Vinshu, while another holds that she is the incarnation of Vinshu’s wife Lakshmi.
