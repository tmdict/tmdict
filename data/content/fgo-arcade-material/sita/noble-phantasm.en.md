Reminisced Unrivaled Bow.
The hard bow given by the destruction god Shiva to an ancestor of Sita and her father King Janaka.
So heavy that it needs eight carts to be carried.
It’s the bow of selection used to choose Sita’s groom. Only one strong enough to string this bow could take Sita as his wife.

While many failed, Rama alone had the strength to string it, and not only that, but also the strength to snap it in half in his attempt. Her marriage with Rama was undoubtedly the greatest fortune in her unfortunate life.

Because she was summoned with the power of another version of Rama, she can string this Noble Phantasm despite not being related to King Janaka by blood.
Can be used even when debuffed and clears all debuffs upon use.
