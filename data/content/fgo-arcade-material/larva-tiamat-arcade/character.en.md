### Personality (Young Body)

Extroverted, but passive.
Fundamentally, she dislikes humanity (she is simply dissatisfied with them and wants to give them a piece of her mind) so she’s pouty, but setting that aside, she is a young girl who possesses a strong determination to protect humanity without fail.
She’s all tsun-tsun towards humanity, but that is only because of her great pride and standpoint that “as the Mother of Creation, she must point out humanity’s faults”.
Having turned into a juvenile form, her broad-mindedness as the “Mother of Creation” has diminished, but the core of her personality and the principles behind her actions have remained the same.
In other words, her motherly nature of “protecting, raising and loving humanity”.
She is a young girl, but also a mother, behaving like a young girl, like a well-bred young lady, but also possessing a motherly touch
She is delicate and innocent, thoughtful like a mother but pure like a young girl
She might take a cold attitude towards humans, but she is very close to them and will quietly draw close and cling to one of your arms.

### Personality (Adult Body)

Introverted, but action-oriented
In her third ascension, her “great pride” and “prickly attitude” disappear almost completely and turns on her overly helpful mode where she earnestly pampers the Master.
Since she fears being told “I hate mom” more than anything, she becomes an older sister that does her best.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

A helper character who appears as a child because she can’t stand the fact that the humans who defeated her in 2017 are about to be destroyed by the Beast.
Tiamat created an Alter Ego with the setting of “resetting herself and being reborn” and sent it to the “Arcade World” created by Beast VI. As a result she has clear memories of being defeated by humanity once. She is always in a bad mood because she remembers that humiliation and pain but this Divine Spirit Servants’ love for humanity is greater than that.

### Dialogue Examples

Typically speaks in halting, broken phrases.
She is arrogant when in her young girl form, but flips to a weak tone when an adult.
“I am Tiamat. Your Servant, ya’ jackass.” (Girl) 
“I, Tiamat…… am your Servant…… mhn” (Adult)
