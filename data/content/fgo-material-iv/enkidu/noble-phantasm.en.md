Enuma Elish.
The very body of Enkidu, transformed into a god forged armament.
Becoming a lynchpin that converts enormous amount of energy, then pierces and binds the target.
Originally, Enkidu was a weapon made use by the gods in order to return Gilgamesh back to the gods.
The “lynchpin of heaven” that holds together gods and men, Gilgamesh.
Due to Gilgamesh rebelling against the gods, Enkidu was given the role to bind him and guide him back to the heavens.

But Enkidu befriended Gilgamesh instead. Enkidu had chosen, just as the one wish of his friend, for a path that use the “chains that binds even gods” for the sake of men.
