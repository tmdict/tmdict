Immortal Chaos Brigade.
Summons the 200 spiritual body of his subordinates, then assaults the enemy group into disorder. Automatically put the the surroundings of the enemy group into darkness, throwing them into a hell of agonizing cries (Avici).
Grants bad status such as confusion and applies moderate damage to the whole enemy.
The fifth Fuuma Kotarou, employed to Houjou’s side, had once infiltrated the encampment of the Takeda army together with his 200 subordinates, throwing fire all around and plundering weapons and supplies.
It is said that the night assault that had continued endlessly had inevitably forced the Takeda army to withdraw.

Ogre Trans{{n1}}.
Fuuma Kotarou. It is his true form that had, for generations, been suspected to be that of an oni, or an existance comparable to it. And probably of the figure of one from a foreign country as well, from his stature and appearance.

His reasoning is equipped with Mad Enhancement. All of his status is improved to the extreme, and his stamina is recovered every turn continuously.
As compensations, his life span and internal organs are severely damaged, parts of hims starts breaking down due to putting his brain output to the limit (overdrive), etc.
(In FateGO it is fundamentally not utilized.)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Is it Ogre Transform or Ogre Trance? Im not sure. Context wise transfrom makes more sense, but the katakana read toransu. DO they just shorten Transform into Trans, maybe? Is that a thing in Japanese? Right now using Trans. Inb4 it’s Ogre-like Translation.
Also dunno if the “continue for generations” is referring to the suspicion or to the “true form”; im leaning towards the latter based on what i know about japanese grammar but context wise it’s kinda weird.
