It is originally the poisonous sake drank by Shuten-douji because of Minamoto no Raikou and her Four Heavenly Kings. Now that she became a Heroic Spirit, this poisoned sake has been sublimated into the general existence of Shuten-douji. The “sake’s” only purpose for her is to pollute the surroundings with poison at once. By manipulating its concentration, she can bestow every bad status aliment. If it is at its greatest concentration, it will decompose all of the living body, leaving nothing but a few bones behind. The gourd for the sake, held under her arm, can further change into a weapon that holds a sword in its mouth, and also, it is said to even be a cage that locks up the spoils that fascinated Shuten-douji.

An ability she was endowed with since birth, or a super-high grade special move. She literally “debones” the opponent completely. She extracts the bone without spilling blood————As long as she does not make a mistake in the location of the attack, the opponent will immediately die. Whether it is inherited from her father who is worthy of being a malevolent god, whether it is inherited from her cannibalistic mother, or whether it is an ability that originated from Shuten-douji herself, it is unclear. Now that she exists as a Heroic Spirit, this ability, or technique otherwise, has been transformed into an Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm. One should not necessarily assume that the purpose of doing this is to kill the opponent, but if she feels like doing it, this operates as a Noble Phantasm with an exceedingly high probability of causing instant death.
