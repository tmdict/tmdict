The legendary omnipotence associated with Leonardo da Vinci given shape. It instantly analyzes the target(s) and adjusts his/her greatest attack in accordance with that target(s) before firing, commonly called an all-purpose, specially-made Noble Phantasm. Apparently, it is originally a reflection-type Noble Phantasm that repels attacks by provisionally composing the enemy’s Noble Phantasm on the spot, but those resources are being utilized for the sake of administrating Chaldea.

In “Fate/Grand Order”, a different shape of his/her omnipotence is demonstrated. In other words, it is a magical attack done by deforming in a flash his/her right gauntlet (a support-type, all-purpose gauntlet used for all states of warfare) and giving to the enemy camp a “compulsory” fixed damage by projecting pure magical energy. This damage is one that is not able to be reduced by any defensive-type Noble Phantasm and Skill, not to mention anti-magical energy abilities; that is to say, by putting together a super advanced formula technique that analyzes in real-time, every opponent becomes a susceptible target for his/her magical attack.
