### Personality

Just the usual Scathach.
Is what one’d thought, but being on the waterside makes her a bit more high spirited than usual.
“Being festive in the beach once in a while is good.”
Since she is in the mood for swimming in the ocean, she is dressing more stylishly.
Kind of like between a chief and a senior who acts slightly different from usual during a training camp. Basically, she’s troublesome.
During battle, there are numerous times where she uncharacteristically covers for her allies.

### Attitude towards Master

Since we’re in the beach, might as well have some pleasant times.
You too. Go and enjoy yourself.

Sometimes she gives off the nuance that tells the Master to train, like “Why don’t you do some laps, hmm?” But she stills says “Take a proper rest” too. Seems like more or less she is showing some consideration. However, once the Master is warmed up she’d probably urge him/her to endlessly run over the sandy beach until the end. Don’t show any negligence.
Due to modifying her own spiritual foundation, Scathach’s liveliness is as expected different from usual.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant Assassin, Scathach, has descended here.
Mm. A dress for summer, I see. Or perhaps a dress for the beach?
Matters not. I am still me. Much obliged, Master.”
“I might as well do away with this bind. Charmed as you may, but try not to show an unsightly demise, yes?”
“No excessive parts, I see. Easy to move around too. What’s the matter? You know not where to place your gaze, hmm?”
“That is fine. A basic straightball; that is the way of the Celts.”
“I shall get serious. Just a little bit.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Completely the same with her Lancer manifestation.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The figure of Scathach who, for the sake of adapting in the uninhabited island, modifies her own spiritual foundation.
It’s possible too for her to be different in style from her usual battle manner so that she can moves around easily. She will uses hidden weapons too. So, Assassin.

--Waterside means swimsuit.
--Nothing is strange at all. Yes, nothing at all.

Additionally, she may be an Assassin but her rank of Presence Concealment is quite low.
There’s absolutely no concealment happening here.

### General Armaments

Haha. No need to glare at me so. I am not particularly trying to make you the odd one out. If you wish for it, would you like to change to a swimsuit too?
…What? You don’t want a rehash?
