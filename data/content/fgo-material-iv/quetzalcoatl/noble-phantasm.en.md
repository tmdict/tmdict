Xiuhcoatl Driver. The second coming of the flames that burned down her own temple in order to prevent the Evil God Tezcatlipoca from acquiring its many treasures, during a time when Quetzalcoatl was leaving the Aztecs. Flames envelop the surroundings, and enemies are temporarily prevented from invoking the True Name release of their Noble Phantasms. However, this Noble Phantasm has become extremely ridiculous because of the person’s addiction to lucha libre. Basically, she spins the opponent around in the air and drops them on the top of their head in a piledriver, or accordingly to the situation presented, she might aim to kick the opponent from a height of 1000 meters, becoming a strike as if it is a meteor. Quetzalcoatl herself calls it the Ultimo Tope Patada.

This Noble Phantasm became the reason why Quetzalcoatl has the Rider Class. She summons the Quetzalcoatlus, a Cretaceous-era pterosaur that was given a name deviated from her own’s, and rides it. It is a Phantasmal Species on the Phantasmal to Divine Beast level, which is also far more powerful than the Quetzalcoatlus that actually lived in the Cretaceous period. The Quetzalcoatlus is known as the largest flying animal in history. During the moment of its True Name release, the mounted Quetzalcoatl is able to perform the manipulation of large-scale lightning, winds and rains.

The trump card of Quetzalcoatl. The megalith of the ancient Aztecs. The Aztec calendar said to show all the world’s past and present. This megalith with a 3.75-meter diameter appears overhead, this being a “gate”, and it drags out a portion of her Authority because of Quetzalcoatl being the great foundation of this very activity. Intense solar winds rampage over a vast range, and they will certainly be reflected as god’s majesty itself.
