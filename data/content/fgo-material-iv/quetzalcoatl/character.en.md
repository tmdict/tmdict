Usually, Quetzalcoatl has a feminine tone that is graceful and polite. More or less composed. However, when she encounters something that makes her a little happy, there is a sudden rise in tension within her, and while still like that, she has difficulties in pronunciation, becoming like a pseudo-foreigner in her speech.

### Personality

A god of peace and tranquility. Now, Quetzalcoatl is an enigmatic elder sister who is addicted to lucha libre. A gentle god who guided to prosperity and with affection, the lovely humans. A gentle god with a famous legend. Basically, human beings are the subjects she watches over in the near future, and whether they are people who point their blades or whether they are people who believe in themselves, she thinks about how one should not kill thoughtlessly. A bright optimist. However, a faithful optimist as well. She surely has a smiling face that makes the sun apparent in the hearts of men, and that she surely believes in opening up a path to a happy era, not letting that brightness be extinguished no matter what kind of crisis there is. An elder sister with a very big-hearted spirit, a broad-mindedness that is like the earth, and a bright and passionate disposition that is like the sun.

Nonetheless, Quetzalcoatl’s thought criteria and the scale of her existence is that of a god’s. She cannot capture everything on the same scale as a human being’s, and may even sometimes pass a cruel/brutal judgement as a result. She is without mercy to opponents considered a disaster or a foreign enemy, displaying a terrifying facial expression. For most things, Quetzalcoatl endorses communication and prosperity with a smiling face, saying that “it’s wonderful everybody’s fuineee, so this elder sister is happy!”, but she becomes displeased when talking about alcohol and Tezcatlipoca. This person deeply regrets that she was defeated in the battle with Tezcatlipoca, while simultaneously, she feels a lot of resentment as a result. Rather saying that she is angry at Tezcatlipoca, she becomes “sullen” towards her powerlessness in defeating Tezcatlipoca, who is the spider, and that Jaguar deity. Regarding “alcohol”, it is the biggest reason why she was defeated in the battle against the former Evil God, and although she wants “no more”, she drinks without thinking in order to encourage herself, even now. Only a small bit will get her drunk, and she will state what she really thinks with her “bad self…” And then, she becomes unconscious, having no recollection of it.

The particulars on how Quetzalcoatl got addicted to lucha libre (professional wrestling) is quite simple: she ended up seeing lucha libre during a time when she was summoned into some age, and that overwhelming shock since then made a very strong impression even on her main body sitting on the Throne of Gods, or so it seems.

“So, it’s the body! Something like using weapons to occasionally kill each other, that should be avoided to the utmost care! Even during times of discussion, lucha is the most suitable answer!”

Quetzalcoatl’s favorite luchador is Mistico. As a god of wind, and as a god of the Morning Star, she observed the luchadores (luchadoras in the case of women) flying freely as if they have wings, and she was deeply moved, shedding tears of gratitude, before having experienced then the distant future, or something like that. Thereafter, her fondness for diligence and her characteristic curiosity turned into her fortune, and she became a luchadora just like that, acquiring a persona of a professional wrestling enthusiast that is unprecedented even among the goddesses. She boasts that she can definitely succeed in applying a headlock onto any kind of deity or monster once she puts her mind to it, but because the propagation of lucha libre is centered around aerial techniques, she is currently sealing the locking techniques that are the quintessence of lucha.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

The deities of South America returned to the land of the jungles, stopping their activities in the Age of Gods, but they were dreaming of the development of humanity. Humanity, “even though they are still irrational now, in the distant future, they will be autonomous, they will compete with each other, and through thick and thin, they will become a species prospering far and wide, abundantly, and plentifully”, and for those kinds of deities that arrived by being imported from the outside, they slept, dreaming of the humanity that will become that prosperous species. Those are the deities of South America in the Fate World.

During the moment where Quetzalcoatl is summoned as a Servant, she views something sprouting in her Master, and then becomes deeply moved. Basically, a Servant who loves her Master. However, she does not “love her Master” in the meaning of the broader sense, but she loves the “growth of this seed called mankind that is being nurtured within this Master.”

### Dialogue Examples

“So I think it’s not good to mince them with your snake parts. Isn’t this place more or less, our meeting spot? Disposing our captured prey (humans) here, don’t you have manners in at least dispatching them back at your nest?”
“Oh well… It’s certainly my favourite way of fighting, although… either way, it’s still unacceptable; if you lose at this contest of strength, you get minced, and as one would expect, the difference in our ranks is because Mars is my heart, among other things! It’s a very messy way to kill yeuuu!”
“Oh. If you are poor at planchas, are you poor at landing too? You can’t become skilled then as a first-class luchador like that.”
“That’s ragretfulll! You’re not worthy enough for that altotudeee!”
“Ah!————Jeez, I love **-kun / **-chan————! I’m pleased that I entered the Goddess Alliance————!”
“Thank you. I lost, Master! So this is the first time a human beat me! The goddess of South America, Quetzalcoatl! From here on, I’ll wield my power for your sake!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

One of the supreme existences in Central and South America as well as in Aztec Mythology. In mythology, Quetzalcoatl is a gentle god who loves peace, and it is said that she bestowed many blessings to the humans. The meaning of her name is “Winged Serpent”. It is said that she is called both the god of wind and the god of culture. There is also a legend that she is a Sun God who governed the sun for a time.

Quetzalcoatl was once regarded as the same as the Good God Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, who is the embodiment of the Morning Star, and she denied the sacrifices the humans offered to the gods “as unnecessary.” Although she guided the people to prosperity by bestowing them many knowledges such as agriculture and fire, all while loving everybody, she bought the resentment of the god Tezcatlipoca, and in the end, she was defeated in battle by him; it is said that she took off to Venus from the Aztecs, and her figure was erased. Prophecies were left behind of her return to the Aztecs once again; later on, the Aztec people believed that Quetzalcoatl had returned with the Spanish people and reached the decision of having the Aztecs perish.

Originally a male deity, at the time of materialization, Quetzalcoatl obtained an existence as a female deity. Maybe she was drawn towards the image of Venus (Aphrodite), the goddess of beauty and of the planet Venus, due to the influence of planet Venus’s existence which is regarded as the same as Quetzalcoatl’s for a long time, or so Quetzalcoatl herself says.

The deities of South America are greatly unlike the other mythological systems of deities, and those South American deities would take action in “transferring from one human to another.” Even the god Quetzalcoatl was identified in several ways according to different regions, and it may not come to light that this female body of some time period became Quetzalcoatl.

### Role within the Game

Quetzalcoatl appeared in Chapter 7. One of the goddesses in the Three Goddess Alliance meant to destroy the Mesopotamian World. A goddess of Central and South America as well as of Aztec Mythology. One of the goddesses summoned by Tiamat. Her favorite phrase in the moments of agitating her opponent is “Yucatán?” Seen as free and uncontrolled, she is a goddess full of kind-hearted intelligence. She hates sacrificial ceremonies and loves mankind. She knows the lucha libre (professional wrestling) of Central and South America by materializing, and she is receiving a great influence from this.

Quetzalcoatl joined the Goddess Alliance in order to protect the humans. Although she is disgusted with the Holy Grail, she does not want the transfer of the Holy Grail to the other two goddesses to happen, so she decided to carry out the fall of Uruk. That person’s principle was called “knocking all humans down to the cement one by one.” Something is suspicious.

Fundamentally, Quetzalcoatl wrestles barehanded, but of course, she will also make use of a weapon from her myth. That weapon’s name is the Macana. A weapon that wears a comprehensible outward appearance, and it is very painful to punch on.

The Yucatán Peninsula is the place where a meteorite fell and caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and a mythological system was cultivated above this plateau, concealing the “bestowed ‘blood’ from an outside astronomical object.” The first generation Kukulkan (the name of Quetzalcoatl in Mayan Civilization) was an existence that possessed elements (bacteria and microorganisms) of this outside astronomical object, or so it was told. This backbone is closely matched with Altera’s, and yet, it was a visitor from the universe more ancient than Altera. However, there is a discrepancy where Altera was an invader while Kukulkan was a being adrift in space.
