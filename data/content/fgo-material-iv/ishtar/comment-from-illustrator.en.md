Although Ishtar’s picture was finished up to total completion on one occasion, I felt that “Hmm… Somehow, I have a feeling that this is not it”, so I continued overtime work on this even in spite of the picture being completed already; the appearance of my state of being is like saying “Since that drawing is already accepted, it’s fine, it’s fine”, but I went as far as continually dismissing that inside me, and then, I got to accept my drawing, saying “… If it is this… yeah” after making my third rough sketch, so it was that drawing of Ishtar that I immediately pushed to replace with.

Since the first picture was a hard picture to draw because it fluctuated when I became tense from mental strain, I recalled wondering if it was good. If it is said that, ‘as a result of Ishtar being a deity who rules over war, comparatively anything can properly be a reasonable Class for her’, it then becomes a strained interpretation of an Archer as well; although, she is a goddess, so I took into consideration a weapon with a form that can work similar to a bow, and I remember wondering boldly what can be something more fascinating for an enormous Noble Phantasm she can carry in her hand. However, that weapon that can work similar to a bow turned out to be something unexpected, “I’ll make that as Maanna, ok?”, and this Maanna was added to the setting afterwards.

By the way, the colouring of Maanna references the gold and blue colours of the Ishtar Gate. And then, the earrings references a statue of Ishtar. And finally, speaking of the image of Archer regarding Rin Tohsaka… I added a loincloth to her first look. Although she has a lot of skin exposure, considering the Mesopotamian culture and the nature of the goddess Ishtar, I wonder if that seems to show more skin in this way… Right, of course… I did not think she would have screen time later on in the summer as well… yeah.
