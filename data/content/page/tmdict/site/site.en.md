For this last update of the year, we are introducing some major changes to CHALDEAの記録: from now on CHALDEAの記録 will no longer carry contents that come directly from the FGO game, this includes some servant in-game profiles, as well as all CE data (these contents are widely available on many sites and wiki, we recommend checking out Atlas Academy DB).

The old Servant section is repurposed into a more generic Character Profile section, which will focus on profile translations found in material books from the wider Type-Moon universe. We’ve also added all glossary data to the site, presented in a more modern and (hopefully) user-friendly interface, think of it as what a modern version of TMdict could look like!

These changes allow us to focus on more important and interesting contents (as opposed to spending time parsing through thousands of CE game files, which can be quite tedious).

Finally, we’ve also updated the site’s backend, and onboarded a new search engine that supports fuzzy search. Let us know if you find any issues!

- Changed Servant section in CHALDEAの記録 to Character Profile.
- Added Crypters, Surtr, and a few side character profiles from FGOM7 and 8 to CHALDEAの記録.
- Added Luminary profile from Katatuki Kouhon to CHALDEAの記録.
- Removed CE section from CHALDEAの記録.
- Updated search engine.
- General site improvement.

Long time no see! The past few months we’ve been busy upgrading the site’s backend and porting contents to a better database, the codebase is now a lot cleaner and the dictionary database much more scalable and easier to update. This upgrade will also make porting TMdict to mobile apps in the future a reality.

For those who like to see everything on one page, we’ve also added a “Books” section, where you can browse the contents by glossary. The diff feature has been taken down, as everything (including the database) is now available on GitHub and version controlled. Finally, minor edits have been made to several categories and entry translations.

- Major overhaul of site backend
- Moved glossary database to SQLite
- Added books/glossary section
- Removed glossary diff feature
- Edited several incorrectly translated/assigned categories
- Edited Chinese translation errors in Tsukihime glossary

**2015-08-16**

A glossary diff feature has been implemented in order to keep track of changes to site content. Missing entries in the Chinese version of Tsukihime Dictionary Revised (_Plus Period_) have also been added.

- Added glossary diff feature to keep track of change
- Added missing Chinese entries from Tsukihime Dictionary Revised (Dokuhon)

**2015-07-29**

Some big backend changes, the site now supports 3 kinds of entries: 1) entry with a common category, a normal glossary entry with one or more sortable category/tag 2) entry with unique category, an entry with a one-of-a-kind category, non-filterable (since by definition there’s already only one of it), this is to account for a select few glossary formats, and 3) entries with no category, this opens up the possibility to add “non-glossary” entries such as those from _Fate/Complete Material 3_, think of it more as a future-proof change. Categories are now also clickable and will lead you to a filtered list when clicked. Most of the changes are under-the-hood. In terms of content, entries from Nasu’s _Notes._ have been added, bumping our version number to 1.1.0.

- Changed site categorization scheme for future expansion
