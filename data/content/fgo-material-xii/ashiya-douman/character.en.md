### Personality

Fate/Grand Order’s Ashiya Douman is openly antagonistic against the capital and people protected by Abe no Seimei.

He portrays himself as a transcendental being, who is deeply experienced in handling the five elements, sometimes even able to manipulate nature (the gods), and ridicules all the small, transient masses who live modest lives.

He loves trampling the pride and faith of people for his own amusement.

(That’s why Girl Musashi despises him like a snake or a scorpion)

Due to being manifested in the Alter Ego class, they are considered to be a caricaturized aspect of the existing Ashiya Douman, not a complete representation of the real figure. But, Caster Murasaki Shikibu’s accounts imply that Douman from the past was that much inhuman and untrustworthy.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

He will never disclose his wish for the Holy Grail.

If asked by his Master, he’ll simply respond cheerful and dodgy laughter.

You musn’t forget. There exist some who, even when taken where the light shines and turned into a brother-in-arms fighting to protect the world, refuse to turn a new leaf and remain unshakeable in their wickedness.

### Dialogue Examples

“NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN”
“NNN… Delightful. Your grudge and chagrin are truly delightful.”
“This arouses my nerves.”
“You mustn’t fret. I wouldn’t dare kill you. I’ll tear your limbs off before I make love to you for forty-nine days leaving you in a state neither alive nor dead.”
“Yes.”

### Character Image

Eyes like polished obsidians, and a face constantly wearing a smile cruel to the point of perfection. A body so fierce that it could tear his enemies apart barehanded, if needed. An Youkai Beast in human shape, who manages to leave an impression of beauty on those who behold them.

An onmyouji monk from the Heian era. Also known as Douma Houshi or Bhikku Douman. The inhuman human who took Heian’s strongest spellcaster, Abe no Seimei, as his opponent.

He’s classified not as a hero who protects the people, but as an anti-hero, who unscrupulously harms people, and whose extinction lead society to peace and tranquility. He’s said to have harmed the authority of the time, Fujiwara no Michinaga, with his hex. Unlike Abe no Seimei, who belonged to the Bureau of Onmyou, a government organization, Ashiya Douman was a Buddhist priest, and, in a sense, an enemy of the government. Their relationship seemed to have been mutually cooperative at first… but at some point, Douman started seeing Seimei and the Bureau of Onmyou as enemies, and opposed them time and time again. In the still pronouncedly arcane Heian Japan, the clashes between the two greatest masters of spells must have been amazing.

Also, if were to take the legends at face value, Douman died several times. Fate/Grand Order says that he mastered the secret arts of Hakudou Jounin, having already attained pseudo-immortality during his lifetime.

Alterego Ashiya Douman is not exactly Ashiya Douman the onmyouji who once existed. In his formation as an Alterego, he implanted 2 Divine Spirits and 1 grudgeful spirit in their own Saint Graph, becoming a High Servant.

The Divine Spirits and evil spirit are listed as follows:
1. The goddess Itzpapalotl from Aztec mythology
2. The evil god Chernobog from Slav mythology
3. The grudgeful spirit Demonic Minister of the Left from Heian Japan.

After fusing with these three, he gained the mighty power of a High Servant and took the name “Caster Limbo” working for the Alien God…… Or so it seemed……?

The Alter Ego Ashiya Douman, summoned to Chaldea, acts as a disciple of the Alien God and pretends to have no recollection of the fact that he often antagonized Chaldea. He declares that he has “no idea” why he was summoned as an Alter Ego with various powers that would have been impossible for him to have wielded in life. Of course, this is false.

The Alter Ego Limbo summoned to Chaldea is unmistakably hostile to Chaldea and encompasses the record of Ashiya Douman who strived to make his darkness cover the world.
Was it an accidental coincidence arising from Chaldea’s interactions with him, or was it derived from pan-human history that questions not the source of power as long as power can be gained, or did the Alter Ego Ashiya Douman wish it to be so? (The effect of a Heroic Spirit wishing for such a thing is entirely unverified. What effect might it have on summoning or on the present world?).

### In Seven Duels of the Heroic Spirit Swordmasters

He appeared in Singularity (actually closer to a Lostbelt at that point) Shimousa as Caster Limbo, one of the 7 Heroic Spirit Swordmasters tormenting Chaldea’s Master and Girl Musashi. The Master’s party ultimately defeated him in Onriedo Castle, except not really.

### In the Indian and Atlantic Lostbelts

The Saint Graph pulverized in the Shimousa was only a Shikigami. Douman repeatedly multiplied his malignant information self, becoming essentially a deathless being working behind the scenes in multiple Lostbelts until Scandinavia Peperoncino’s Abhijna stripped him of his shikigami multiplication.

### In Naraka Mandala Heian-kyō

Forced to utilize his remaining main body, he produced a Singularity in Heian, medieval Japan. He attempted to elevate himself to the status of a new Alien God —a new Beast— but failed to attain complete Beasthood for one reason: “A rakshasa devoid of love for humanity is unqualified to be Beast” (quote by Abe no Seimei).

He then merged himself with the Fantasy Tree. Under the name Rakshasa King: Skull Eboshi Ashiya Douman, he clashed against Chaldea’s Master’s party and the Genji faction in order to establish the Hell Lostbelt, and died a glorious death.

### General Armaments

Cursing attacks utilizing shikigami and talisman and barehanded attacks utilizing his robust and flexible body.
