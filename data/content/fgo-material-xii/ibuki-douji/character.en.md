### Personality

Her temperament as a “god/kami” is quite potent with her self-awareness of being a part of nature (the world) being very firm.
She acts based on primitive desires.
She has almost no inclination to come into contact with humans and their culture/civilization at all.
She behaves as if she is unaware of the depths of alcohol, the delicacy of human lives, and the pleasure of indulging in a moment of insanity, however…
Once she immerses herself in desires, she will show no mercy.
Without any stimulus, she is harmless, however, in a certain sense, one could say that she is even more dangerous than Shuten-douji.

Once someone manages to pique her interest, she will be strongly fixated on them.
While the target of her interest exists, her eyes will always be fixed on them.
Usually, she’d stretch her long fingers towards them, touch them, and destroy them completely───or, she would corrupt them and guide them to their death.

The oni species that her other aspect also belongs to can easily pique her interest. Naturally, existences similar to her (children of a dragon god) would also make her eyes sparkle.

…The above is the original Ibuki-douji’s nature, but the circumstances of the one that materialized in Chaldea are somewhat different.

She’s totally
Being influenced
By the modern age.

Even if she can’t look at things from the same standpoint as a human being due to her origin being that of a god, her words and conduct are that of “a big sister Heroic Spirit/Divine Spirit who’s gotten way too used to modern society”.
Her behavior shows that she’s studied what human beings could be like.

She even goes around trying to seduce and provoke others, including the Master.
The Heroic Spirit Sherlock Holmes speculates that Ibuki-douji had either learned about modern society somewhere, or she met a Heroic Spirit who also got accustomed to modern society in a similar way, and then forcibly brought over those records by taking advantage of the uniqueness of Chaldea’s summoning system. Nobody knows whether that is true or not, however.

When she gets serious, for example when releasing her Noble Phantasm’s True Name, she seems to regress to behaving according to her original nature which is that of a “god/kami”, but usually, she’s enjoying herself as the carefree “snake big sis”.

<>

Also, when she’s in her juvenile form (the Saint Graph of her first stage), she displays speech and conduct that is like a mix of “snake big sis Ibuki” and “Ibuki, the god/kami”.
When little Ibuki says that things will get dangerous if she molts, she is most probably referring to becoming “Ibuki, the god/kami”.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Normally, Ibuki-douji doesn’t give much special attention to the Master that summons her.
It’s probably because her awareness of humans is too abnormal, what with viewing them as a collective whole instead of as separate individuals.
If she became able to view them as individuals, her behavior towards them would also gradually change.
If she ever grows interested in you, you must stay vigilant instead of rejoicing about that accomplishment.
Her fingertips are that of a god, so even defensive magecraft against poisoning or poison resistance skills would be far from enough to protect you.

However…
The Ibuki-douji that materialized in Chaldea behaves in an intimate way towards the Master. Strictly speaking, she behaves in a friendly manner with everyone. For her to properly recognize the Master as an individual, they would need to build a relationship that is deep enough for that.
In that sense, as expected, one must make sure whether the normal Ibuki-douji’s nature stems from her roots or not.

◇

Completely different from her usual version, there are times when juvenile Ibuki-douji views her Master as “someone to be reared”.
It’s as if she’s treating her Master as a pet…
Not like she’s ever kept a pet before.

### In Naraka Mandala Heian-kyō

She is manifested by Alter Ego Limbo aka Ashiya Douman as “Taisuishin”, the last of his trump card known as the Eight Cavalry Summoning that he modeled after the Eight General Gods in Taoism. (However, finding her rank as a General God and the immortality that comes with it unnecessary, Ibuki-douji discards them. Since she’s already a powerful Divine Spirit, the buffs Limbo prepared are surely nothing but annoyances to her.)
For a time, she is treated as the vessel of a “new ’Alien God’ and Beast”, but due to Limbo’s sudden change of mind, she is absorbed by the Subspecies Fantasy Tree Hell Realm Mandala.
However, in truth, she was alive and well inside the Fantasy Tree───
By lending her Noble Phantasm, Divine Sword - Kusanagi-no-Tachi to the Kintoki piloting the Settsu-Style Great Armour Kumano, she played a role in the destruction of the Subspecies Fantasy Tree.

### Dialogue Examples (Second and Third ascensions)

“───You’ve called for me. Just kidding. No need to freeze up like that. I see, so this is Chaldea. Hmm, it looks interesting. I’ll be in your care from now on, Master-san!” “Offerings are not popular these days, you know?” “I’m in the mood for a drink…” “I-I won’t strip yet, you know? I finally got to pick a modern outfit for myself and all…Ah. Or what? Did you mean you want to u-n-d-r-e-s-s little old me? Ahaha. I see~”
“Good night. Have a pleasant dream.”

### Dialogue Examples (First ascensions)

“Shall we play? Hey, hey?”
“Are you, forgetting your place?”
“A tsuchinoko grows by sleeping, you know? I’m gonna sleep.” “Let me play a bit longer, good grief…”
“───I am Ibuki-douji. Are you what they call a Master? I see, I see, so that’s what you are… Alright. If you don’t want to die then you better butter me up.”

### Dialogue examples (Offshoot Mitama of the Serpent God)

“The mundane world and the world of the dead…” “Look up to me like you’d look up at a god (the sky). Kiss me like you’d kiss a god (the earth).” “I am one of Yamata’s offshoot mitama (heads). A calamity that descended from the mountains───” “To put it in a way that would be easy for you to understand, let’s see… I am a calamity to all you living beings.”

### Character Image

Ibuki-douji.
The alternate name of “Shuten-douji” who was from the base of Oumi’s Mount Ibuki.
Ibuki-douji, with her naturally inconceivable birth of having come into this world as a demon child, grew up in the mountains and eventually obtained fearsome and abnormal abilities.
She moved to Mount Ooe where she became “Shuten-douji”, the great monstrosity who descended on the capital and entertained herself with massacres and pillaging────

<>

Some say she is the child of Mount Ibuki’s Ibuki Daimyoujin (= Yamata-no-Orochi) and a human while others say she is the heaven-sent child of Mount Togakushi (= Kuzuryuu).
Either way, she is the child of a dragon deity.
With her current Saint Graph, her aspects as “the bunrei of Ibuki Daimyoujin, the child of Yamata-no-Orochi” are particularly emphasized and she has materialized as a Divine Spirit Servant.
She isn’t a human.
She isn’t an oni.
She is a god.

In the end, was she really a supernatural being born as a demonic child like the legends of Oumi say?
Or perhaps she was the divine child of Mount Togakushi?
Or maybe, much like how spirits come into being, she might have been born in yet another way────
Regarding this matter, Ibuki-douji’s lips are sealed.
However, the blood of a god certainly flows in her veins, and the blade she wields as her Noble Phantasm is without a doubt the one that was pulled out of Yamata-no-Orochi’s tail in those ancient legends.

<>

It seems Ibuki-douji in her juvenile form had met Sakata Kintoki on Mount Ashigara.
Kintoki, the monstrous child who was neither the spawn of a mortal nor the spawn of the oni, met her while wandering Ashigara, fought each other in a sumo brawl for some reason, and suffered a crushing defeat.

After that encounter, Ibuki-douji will disappear.
She hasn’t died by any means; she lived on, having transformed into a different existence, a different aspect of herself.
In other words, she became the great monstrosity “Shuten-douji” in both mind and body.

By connecting the testimonies together, it would appear that Ibuki-douji and Shuten-douji existed by alternating with each other at either fixed or uncertain intervals.
“It’s my (Ibuki’s) turn now.”
“Next, it will be my (Shuten’s) turn.”
Or so the order went────

### Connections with Characters

#### Shuten-douji

They can not accurately recognize each other’s existence.
To Ibuki-douji, she is nothing more than “something she does not understand well”. The same goes for Ibuki-douji from Shuten-douji’s point of view. They don’t even try to recognize the other as a version that could possibly exist.
Ibuki-douji is not “Shuten-douji’s former self” and Shuten-douji is not “Ibuki-douji’s new self”.

#### Mochizuki Chiyome

An object of interest. If she harbors the curse of Ibuki Daimyoujin within her body then they are like relatives. (Ibuki treats her as a younger sister in her first ascension and as a relative’s child in her second and third ascensions)

#### Quetzalcoatl / Medusa / Gorgon / Vritra / Kukulkan

A serpent god from a foreign country.

#### Sakata Kintoki

Smells good. Has a nice eye color. Has nice bones. Very interesting.
She can feel the presence of a dragon.

#### Ibaraki-douji / Fuuma Koutarou / Tomoe Gozen / Kijo Koyou

Oni. Oni can be often seen in the mountains. Very interesting.

#### Minamoto no Raikou

An oni that is one yet not. Instead of interesting, she finds her suspicious. “Just what is that?” is her impression of Raikou.

#### Habetrot

A mass of cuteness.
They’ve been getting along since they traveled in Tunguska together.
