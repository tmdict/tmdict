### Personality

Compered to when she was an Assassin she wants to hang around and mess around with Master more. She wants to be by their side always and monopolize their gaze, not necessarily because that’s what she wants but because she wants Master to fall in love with her. In other words a manifestation of Mara’s aggressive side(or so she claims)

“Well since it a swimsuit, you can look wherever you want, so it should be an easy victory for me. I’ll even help you if you run into any trouble, but I don’t think you’ll shift your attention to other swimsuit Servants after that, right?”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Her basic stance hasn’t changed and she still isn’t conscious of wanting to be loved. (Even if such a wish exists it’s deep desire that will never surface) She has completely devoted all of her attacks into corrupting Master For that reason she nervous when they counter attack

Kama was thinking…

“Am I not being taken seriously anymore? Are they treating me like a child, thinking they can keep me in check just by giving me cake? I mean, I’m certainly not about to start taking my job as the god of love seriously or anything, but everyone not taking me seriously kind of pisses me off, too.

Pārvatī used to be so wary of me, but now she just smiles and says things like, ’Try not to get up to too much mischief now, okay?’ Well, if she’s going to harass me like that, I’ll just have to remind her why she was scared of me in the first place, won’t I”

And so, Kama made up her mind. She was going to show everyone that she was not only the god of love, but also the terrifying Demon King of Depravity! The arrival of summer presented the perfect opportunity.

“You know, this is a good chance for me to put everything I have into corrupting Master once and for all. There’s no way I can fail in a swimsuit, especially once I bring out my affectionate (laughs) side. Then I’ll have my revenge against Pārvatī and everyone else who’s been humiliating me by treating me like a damn kid! I can’t wait to see the looks on their faces when they realize their mistake!”

Kama claims that this new version of her is her Mara side showing through more than usual, which is why she’s being bolder and more demonic (frankly, “impish” is a better word here) with her attempts to corrupt Master. But how is that actually different from usual? Honestly? It isn’t. She’s the same Kama she always is. The only real difference is that she’s now more openly trying to seduce Master into depravity in a way she feels fits the summer season.

What’s more, the extreme optimizations she’s made for offense have left her defenses incredibly weak…which is to say, she’s a pushover now. Even when she suggests things like sharing a soda with a double straw, she blushes crimson when it actually comes time to drink. This is why Pārvatī no longer considers her a threat. It hardly takes a goddess to see that her attempts to seduce Master into a life of depravity will inevitably end in abject failure.

That said, even in this summer Spirit Origin, Kama is still just as much herself and Mara as ever. That ratio is six parts Kama to four parts Mara in her usual form, and four parts Kama to six parts Mara in her Beast form. But now, incredibly enough…!

“Kama may insist she’s seven parts Mara right now, but she’s actually still mostly Kama, as usual.” (Source: Pārvatī)
