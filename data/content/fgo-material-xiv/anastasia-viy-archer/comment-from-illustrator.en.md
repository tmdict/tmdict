As the Anastasia of Pan-human History, I imagined her as this sweet yet mischievous duchess. I figured she’d be the type to have a lot of interactions with Servants in Chaldea, so when designing the first draft, I imagined her going for a walk with Marie on the beach, laughing and having a good time. Then I also started thinking if this were the Lostbelt Anastasia, maybe she would’ve preferred something more mature~ Or maybe she would’ve tried to coordinate her outfit with Kadoc’s~ I had a lot of fun coming up with fantasies like that. One duchess with the appeal of two… How wonderful. (sime)
