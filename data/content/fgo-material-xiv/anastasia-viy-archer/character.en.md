### Personality

With it being summer, and with a swimsuit Saint Graph, her bothersome default traits have been softened, and her mischievous side has been completely pushed to the forefront.
However, because of this, she’s more liable to not think twice about doing the kind of reckless things she normally wouldn’t. As such, extra caution is advised.
When walking your festive rounds with a laugh, you might find she suddenly dove head-first into a pool of lava.

### Attitude towards Master

When it comes to her Master, she wants to cradle them as one would a cat, play with them whimsically as one would a cat, treat them crudely as one would a cat, and spoil them as one would a cat.
Guess she just seems them as an actual cat? Meow~

### Dialogue Examples

“Now that I’m in a swimsuit, I’m up for anything! Let’s have the time of our lives♪”
“Catch~! Let’s smash the watermelon~!”
“Ah, who would’ve thought summer was so much fun! Winter is just way too cold!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Just as the magic of summer once enticed a die-hard shut-in to become a master of outdoor survival games, so too has it changed Anastasia into an outdoors, prank-loving, snickering girl.
Her Master might be the only one capable of stopping her from running amok.

If Anastasia the Caster emphasized the Grand Duchess part of herself, then this one emphasizes the free-spirited aspect she originally possessed…that is to say, her mischievous side.

As a result, she cares much less for personal space (even putting aside her tendency to get very physically close to those with whom she is emotionally close) and her impish side also enjoys seeing people flustered around her.

However, perhaps because she has shut out the Grand Duchess part of herself, the loneliness she experiences without her brother and older sisters has been magnified. If, as her Master, you would like to get to know her better, then you should try to do whatever you can to help stave off her loneliness.

When changing into her swimsuit, she thusly professed to her friends in Chaldea:
“Well, I am a Grand Duchess, you know? I’ll remain as well-mannered as always.”
(Needless to say, her friends laughed heartily at those words, and a fight broke out shortly thereafter.)

However, what came to stand in her way in this case was not pure innocence, manners, or anything of the sort.
More than a beautiful carnivore, there was a natural bombshell of a girl—a simple, dimwitted girl (the latter of which was self-proclaimed) by the name of Charlotte Corday (in a swimsuit).

“Are you putting on a character of me? You’re acting, right? Hell, you’re even a Caster!!”

Thus, the fate of these two were firmly interlocked, and as a result, they eventually became friends.

“How about the left half is mine, and the right half is yours, what do you think about that?” (Anastasia)
“Sounds good to me!” (Corday)

“This is not good at all”, “this is really bad,” they would yell as they were being chased by the Chaldean police, but for now this was something to come much later on.

### Connections with Characters

#### Marie Antoinette (Summer)

She and I are going for the same type of character? Eh, please tell me we don’t overlap that much! We’re gonna have to have a little talk, Master.

#### Mordred (Summer)

Don’t you think she’s getting way too close with Master? Huh, I’m the exact same? I don’t know about that…

#### Charlotte Corday (Summer)

A magic trick? What kind of ridiculous game is this? Huh, wait, that’s…amazing! She just cut a person in half, Master! Makes sense all that screaming and shouting was just an act, right? Master…? Say something, Master! Ah, medic! Can we get a medic here!?
