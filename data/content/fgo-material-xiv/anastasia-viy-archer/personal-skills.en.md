### Shvybzik(Summer): B+

Summertime Shvybzik.
It becomes possible for Anastasia to manipulate, materialize, and produce anything she recognizes as summery.

### Freezing Summertime: A

―――So much fun.
One might almost wish for time to stop.
A forced standstill caused by Viy’s Mystic Eyes.
Rather than used on others, it cloaks oneself in order to cause all attacks to come to a halt before they hit, for a certain period of time.

### Accelerated Elemental Eyes: B

Viy’s Mystic Eyes changed into a state of continuous activation.
It creates a maelstrom of surrounding Magical Energy, providing Anastasia with favourable circumstances.
To put it in game terms, it’s like being able to one-sidedly keep shooting at your opponent from an elevated position.
