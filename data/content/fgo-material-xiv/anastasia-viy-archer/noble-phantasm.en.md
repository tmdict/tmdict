Snegleto Snegurochka.
Snegurochka is a snow woman of folklore, though she's not particularly related to this Noble Phantasm.
By means of Viy's Mystic Eyes, the seasons are temporarily inverted. This Noble Phantasm uses the enormous amount of energy generated by this motion as an attack.
In contrast to its magnificent appearance, it is actually considerably fierce.

Underthrow Freeze Sinker.
The Grand Duchess' certain knockout underthrow pitching technique, throwing what appears to be a snowball at first glance.
In actuality, it's a compressed block of ice coated in a dusting of powder snow, which with the addition of rotation achieves unimaginable destructive power.
It's just that Viy's Mystic Eyes causes even a straight pitch to repeatedly curve forcefully.

Fundamentally not used in FateGO.
