“I had a clear image in mind for the Second Ascension, but I struggled with the designs for the First and Third Ascensions. It felt like I added elements and then gradually removed them. Especially for the Third Ascension, I had a lot of doubts! I hope I can show you the design ideas that didn’t make the cut someday.” (Azusa)
