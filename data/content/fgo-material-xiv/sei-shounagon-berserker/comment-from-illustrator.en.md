Sei gets a swimsuit! On that occasion, I wanted to draw a brand of Sei Shounagon fashion different from her usual outfits. Street fashion, gyaru, sukeban… there were a lot of outfits I wanted to try and I got to do them all. Close-fitting clothes are cute but clothes that show off a lot of skin are awesome. I love them.
