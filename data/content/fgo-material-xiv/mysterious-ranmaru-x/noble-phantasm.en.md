The very cute Ranmaru-chan throws their Fudou Yukimitsu (Immovable Yukimitsu), which separates limitlessly, towards their opponents before following up with a slash with all their strength. There is no way to escape from the gaze of their completely unleashed right eye, and all who confronts Ranmaru will be captivated by the extreme cuteness and splendidness of those attack movements of theirs, before they would be chopped up during their unguarded moment of saying “YOWZERS, RANMARU IS SO CUTE!”, making this a Noble Phantasm that unexpectedly overloads people mentally and catches them off guard as a result.

The Fudou Yukimitsu Saber is a sword for self-defense that came flying in from out of nowhere at the time Ranmaru was born.
The Ranmaru Blade is a legendary oodachi that Ranmaru won in the Great Ranmaru War that determined the strongest Ranmaru. It is a very advanced first-rate sword that has the ability to carry out interstellar flight. However, it just so happens that its original engraved signature has been lost, so it is now called the Ranmaru Blade as a result.
