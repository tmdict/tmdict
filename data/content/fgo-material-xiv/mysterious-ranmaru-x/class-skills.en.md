### Magical Resistance: C

A Skill that nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of two verses or below.

“Ranmaru cannot defend against large-scale Magecraft such as Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.”

### Oblivion Correction: E

People, who are living beings, will be forgetful, but Ranmaru will never forget… of the things they wished upon that star.

### Existence Outside of the Domain: D

A being that descended from the void of outer space?

“Well, given that Ranmaru came from Planet Ranmaru, there should be no doubt about that matter.”

### Avenger: C

One’s state of being as an avenger that gathers people’s hatred and resentment onto themselves; a way of being that became a Skill.

“Ranmaru is gathering the feelings of all the Ranmarus from Planet Ranmaru.”

### Ranmanium: EX

Mysterious Ranmaru particles that exist in every Ranmaru born on Planet Ranmaru. Those particles are very mysterious, but it is said that the more of these particles that are within the body, the more outstanding the Ranmaru is. The amount of Ranmanium Ranmaru X has surely makes them the highest EX-ranked quality Ranmaru, surpassing even the Ranmaru who possessed a style that surpassed the most magnificent Ranmaru among all Ranmarus in history.

### Affection of the Demon King: EX

Ranmaru possesses a strange special characteristic that makes them indiscriminately beloved by those who possess specific qualities (mainly by those of the ruling class). Whether or not this is due to Ranmanium – a mysterious magical element their body has – is a point discussed by the scientific society even to this day where their opinions are still divided.
