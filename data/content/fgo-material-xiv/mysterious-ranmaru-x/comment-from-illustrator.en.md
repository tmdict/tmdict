I repeatedly went through a lot of trial and error on my part in designing Mysterious Ranmaru X. I even created too many facial expressions for them, to the extent that I do not remember how many I made overall. Is this cool? Is this expressive? Does this make them resemble someone? Does this make them look like they are joking around? Is this serious?â€¦ I wanted to draw Mysterious Ranmaru X whose facial expressions were changing frequently. (Mika Pikazo)
