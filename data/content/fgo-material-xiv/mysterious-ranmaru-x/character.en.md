### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

“Hey, I am the type to serve in a brisk and efficient manner towards those whom I recognize as my lord!”

### Dialogue Examples

“Mysterious Ranmaru X, the super A-class page soaring through the galaxy, has just arrived now for you!”
“Ranmaru will kill yooou!”
“At the end of an endless journey, there is a treasure Ranmaru has finally discovered. Ranmaru is here! OOORCHID ROOOUNDS… XXXXXXX!”
“Hey, to think that there is someone who would oppose Ranmaru’s Master; that naturally means they can be killed off! Right~?!”
“Something Ranmaru likes, huh? Of cooourse, it is Ranmaru’s Master! Every Ranmaru lives for the sake of their lord, and dies for the sake of their lord. Because that… is the fate of those who were born as Ranmaru.”

### Historical Image · Character Image

Mori Naritoshi, a military commander from the Warring States Period. The third son of Mori Yoshinari, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga. A page of Oda Nobunaga, they were known by the popular name of Ranmaru. They died together with Nobunaga, their lord, during the Honnou-ji Incident————

### Character Image in “FateGO”

————or so goes the history of the original Mori Ranmaru.

“Mysterious Ranmaru X, who came flying in from Planet Ranmaru, a planet that is at the other side of the galaxy where many Mori Ranmarus live, is the Mysterious Mori Ranmaru who holds the title of “Ranmaru X”, a title that only the most outstanding Mori Ranmaru among all Mori Ranmarus is allowed to wear.”
“What is this person saying?”

Apparently, Mysterious Ranmaru X turned up to Earth to take a lost article back of which none of the Mori Ranmarus on their home planet even remember about. Ranmaru X themselves do not even understand what they had forgotten about.

### General Armaments

The Fudou Yukimitsu Saber, the Ranmaru Blade, and their sealed Ranmaru Eye.

### Connections with Characters

#### Oda Nobunaga

Mori Ranmaru’s lord during their lifetimes. But because Nobunaga is not their lord as far as Ranmaru X is concerned, the Ranmarus on Planet Ranmaru are still searching for their own lords who they ought to serve.

#### Mori Nagayoshi

Mori Ranmaru’s older brother during their lifetimes. Since Nagayoshi is unrelated to Ranmaru X, it would be strange for them to call him their older brother, but because they are both strange, this does not feel particularly unusual for either of them. By the way, Planet Nagayoshi, the sibling planet of Planet Ranmaru, is also an extremely dangerous place in the galaxy with a prominent 5-star travel risk rating.

#### Akechi Mitsuhide

‘Ranmaru will seriously not forgive them; the Micchi Akechi clan will be absolutely eradicated.’ That seems to be the feeling etched in every Ranmaru from Planet Ranmaru on the genetic level.
“Ranmaru will kill him as soon as Ranmaru finds him!”

#### Mysterious Heroine X

“That person is truly the legendary Saber Killer who Ranmaru thinks Ranmaru saw on a rental video…! Hey, Ranmaru is an Avenger, so that is irrelevant to Ranmaru!”

#### Mysterious Heroine XX

“That person is truly from a later season who Ranmaru thinks Ranmaru saw on a rental video…! Hey, that said, Ranmaru wants to be armed and ready to actively participate in a second cour too!”

#### Mysterious Heroine X Alter

“That person is truly… or perhaps Ranmaru should say, there are too many ‘Mysterious’s and ‘X’s lined up that there is a feeling Ranmaru cannot make heads or tails of them anymore, but Ranmaru wants to leave the preparations of the manjuu and tea to her.”

#### Mysterious Idol X Alter

“Is there still another X!? But this Ranmaru too clearly has an interest in idol costumes! Ranraraaan♪”
