This is a Noble Phantasm whose True Name Release can only be possible during the moment where Zenobia believes, from the bottom of her heart, that “she was able to prove that she is an ideal Queen”, or that “she can prove that matter by battle”, towards her very own present self. She is not able to invoke it if there is even the slightest doubt within her.

By pouring in all of her Magical Energy, emotional strength, willpower, determination, anger, dignity, etc. that she personally possesses altogether, Zenobia smashes the golden shackles and golden chains that are being deeply connected to her Spiritual Foundation as a Servant, before she transforms into the form of “a what-if that she wished for herself”————the form of “the Queen of the East who shook off the loss and shame that were given to her by Roman Emperor Aurelian and who seized victory from Rome.” That is not only setting herself free from her physical body, but also freeing herself from the mentality of the Zenobia from the past who was imperfect.

It is, so to speak, Zenobia denying the possibility of “a Zenobia who is not in her ideal state, one who might have been smeared in cowardice and pleaded for her life”, the denial coming from the side of the Servant, which is a shadow, and it is identical to a Conceptual Replacement, temporarily repainting her very own existence. On the occasion that this Noble Phantasm’s True Name Release is achieved, all of Zenobia’s Stats will be raised marvellously.
