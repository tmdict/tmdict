Percival is a caring big brother-type, so I decided on thematic lines of “fresh, athletic, and big armor”. I designed him with the intention of seeing his body move dynamically as he fights. He’s not a Celt, he’s a holy knight, is it okay to dress him up with such a tight-fit? I remember I was afraid to ask. He is a Lancer… By the way, his legs and feet are not covered in tights, but boots. Please believe me. (Shiramine)
