Innocence Arondight. A simple Noble Phantasm where Melusine slams the “Fae Blade Arondight” that she refined from her skin into the enemy. The lance version of Lancelot’s Arondight.
With an inflated NP recharge rate, the repeated cuts tearing the target apart increase the damage they take. Its nature of inflicting wounds that would not heal earned it the name “Incision Swordsmanship”.
Its damage as a single target Noble Phantasm is low, but its turnover rate after being able to use it is top rank.
“This chick is firing off Arondight every turn!” is the kind of feeling of peerlessness it gives off.
…To Melusine, this is not her own Noble Phantasm but something she borrowed from Lancelot (an imitation of his Noble Phantasm), and that’s why its damage isn’t that high (why she isn’t serious).

Hollow Heart Albion.
The dragon breath released by Melusine who transformed into her “original form” through her third skill.
Having returned to her “original form”, Melusine can no longer be called a faerie, and the light spilling forth from her majestic heart turns into a weapon of wide-area destruction.
That appearance can be likened to a rainbow over the boundary or a gate to a different realm (the alternate dimension variety).
After it has been used, Melusine will be unable to return to the vessel of the faerie she wished to be and will vanish without anyone noticing.
 
In the Fate universe, Albion is the name of the “Dragon from the Age of Gods” that burrowed deep underground in London in an attempt to return to the “Inner Sea of the Planet”, but died in the process; this Albion is the Lostbelt version of that.
She serves as proof that “the dragon that failed to return to the planet” will meet a cruel end regardless of which Human History we’re talking about.
※In reality, “Albion” is the name of a prehistoric mythical kingdom on the island of Britain.


##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} The kanji (匹) used here and for Hollow Heart Albion is the counter for animals instead of the usual one for humans so I assume everyone is just a small animal to the super-duper dragon Melusine.
