### Personality

Extroverted and active.
Baobhan Sith has the temperament of a ruler, stating her desires without shame and working those around her to the bone for the sake of achieving them. She is a capricious hedonist who cares solely for the pleasure of the moment. Just like any other fairy, she seeks fun, however the only fun she knows are the agonised cries of the weak. As a result, she toys with and tramples upon humans and fairies alike.

She has been conditioned to find joy in such actions as she has never been loved, only praised by her mother Morgan, the sole person she holds affection and respect for, when she torments the weak. A young witch who is both an admirable maiden working diligently for her mother’s love and an arrogant princess who views the kingdom as a toy that will one day be hers. Selfish, fickle, cruel, and horrible.

Benevolence and lip service genuinely sickens her and she thoroughly disparages them. Her reason: “Because they bore me, obviously.” Baobhan Sith held no interest for most things, finding enjoyment only in laying waste to her surroundings. However, Beryl’s stories about Pan-Human History civilisation put a gleam in her eyes, igniting her obsession with imitating it. “Doesn’t a military tournament in a historic castle sound fun? Of course, I’ll massacre everyone other than the winner as punishment ☆”

Along the way, she grew infatuated with the high heels of Pan-Human History, becoming a shoe collector. She is earnest and diligent when it comes to them, harbouring the dream of creating a pair of shoes more stylish than anything a Pan-Human History craftsman could hope for. …In Baobhan Sith’s (the princess’) bedchamber, the bare feet of fairies lopped off at their heels are enshrined like treasure.

### Setting

A member of the British Lostbelt’s Knights of the Round Table. A Fairy Knight who assumed the name of the Saint Graph of Tristan, a knight of Pan-Human History’s Round Table. She received favourable treatment as the daughter and successor of Queen Morgan, the ruler of the British Lostbelt. (She was a vampire fairy prior to becoming Morgan’s daughter.)

One of two raised as mages in a Britain where magecraft was deemed unnecessary. (The other is Artoria). She viewed Artoria, who was rumoured to be Morgan’s daughter, as a rival, and attempted to kill her. However, Morgan stopped her from that direct confrontation, which only served to exacerbate her gratuitous contempt and obsession, leading to her obstructing Artoria’s journey in various ways.

Ascension 1: Fairy Knight Tristan
Her form as a Fairy Knight. Differing from the others, her style mocks those who would don armour and fight in earnest. When hearing about the Knights of the Round Table from Morgan, she thought “they’re all lame, but I guess this one barely passes,” and chose Tristan. Eventually, she came to be fond of the bewitched strings fighting style she imitated from him.

Ascension 2: Morgan’s Successor
A beguiling, elegant, and wicked form, fitting of Queen Morgan’s successor. Her vampiric traits manifest themselves strongly here. Baobhan Sith considers it to be her formal dress, attending the fairy ball in this appearance.

Ascension 3: Beloved Baobhan Sith
…The Baobhan Sith summoned at Chaldea is a ‘dream’ she is watching, with the records of the Fairy Kingdom as its foundation. It is the form she would have taken after having lost the divine protection of Morgan’s magecraft, driven solely by her hatred towards the fae, one in which she’s lost even her sense of self. The sacrificial priestess who became the main cause of the curse calamity. No matter what spells or love she possesses, she will never recover. …However. If there were to be an awakening from the ‘inside’, not a treatment from the ‘outside’. If she were to acquire the strength to take in and overcome the curse, instead of spreading death in fear of it, then perhaps…

### Combat Style

Just like a vampire, she attacks by extending her claws (akin to red lines, they’re like a red version of Tristan’s aerial attack). Being a young witch, she also uses magecraft. She is an expert in the Gandr shot, and is the Gandr firing idol of the fairy world. Her Failnaught Noble Phantasm is also essentially a ‘Suuuuper Gandr’.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Her awful personality remains unchanged even after being summoned. She holds humans in disdain and will not serve the Master even until the end.

### Dialogue Examples

“Huh? Why are you clamming up? Making a huge fuss is your job, isn’t it? If you’re not even good for that, just end your lives already! Do you want to fall victim to my strings?”
“That’s right, easy does it. So you guys actually can do it if you give it a try. But don’t you think it’s a little~ lacking in ingenuity? There isn’t enough misery, I’m telling you. So you, you and you. Do exactly what I tell you and be good little guinea pigs for these guys, okay? ♡”
“It’s showtime. See? It’s already over. This is the ruin of what you once were. Fetch Failnaught.”
“Isn’t fate cruel? It doesn’t matter if you’re good or evil. Once people have it out for you, you’re done. Now, become the trash that you are!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A female fairy told of in Scottish folklore. The name simply means ‘she-fairy’. It is said that she appears at night to drain people’s lifeforce and kill them. She is fond of blood and weak to sunlight. Many fairies can both benefit and harm others, but Baobhan Sith is an evil fairy that only causes harm. She resembles a beautiful human woman, but only her legs hidden under her long skirt are of the fae, with heels said to be deer hooves.

### Role within the Game

With first-rate looks but a hideous personality, she plays the role of the hated. But it’s not like she’s nearly as much of a ‘strong foe’ as the other Fairy Knights are, either. A trickster who has a strong position and troublesome abilities. One of the prophesied calamities that would destroy Britain. The curse calamity.

### Connections with Characters

#### Morgan

Her great, beloved mother. While Baobhan Sith holds most people in contempt, Morgan is the sole target of her adoration.

#### Fairy Knight Gawain

Though she knows that Gawain is just acting like a good person, her knowledge of her true nature prevents Baobhan Sith from hating her. “Devouring someone you’ve come to like is something that really hurts. I get it, I really do. I mean, even though you get so infatuated with a slab of meat, you can only ever savour it once, after all! Hahaha, it’s so remarkably pathetic!”

#### Fairy Knight Lancelot

Beautiful, but holds no interest for her. Baobhan Sith instinctively senses that she cannot defeat Lancelot, fostering a faint trace of fear. However, she is also aware of her relationship with Aurora, her Achilles’ heel, which gives her the mental upper hand. She looks forward to the day that bomb goes off with glee.

#### Child of Prophecy, Artoria

The world’s biggest eyesore. She wants to unleash Fetch Failnaught on her until her very form ceases to exist.

#### The Bumpkin Fairy she met in Gloucester

A rare fairy that she could converse with without being plagued by headaches. The memory of that fairy’s resigned gaze at the showcase, as if she was thinking to herself “I’d love to have it, but I know I’m not good enough,” somehow lingers within her.

#### Knocknarea

An impertinent fairy clan that defies Morgan. However, Baobhan Sith is interested in their arcana. “She gets stronger the more slaves she owns? How delightful! ♡” She is unaware that it’s actually the opposite of what she thought.

#### Britomart

A Fairy Knight from Pan-Human History that she came to know in Chaldea. Although Baobhan Sith typically despises goody two shoes and honours students, she does not hate Britomart. Perhaps it’s because unlike the fae of the Fairy Kingdom, she does not possess a fickle temperament swayed by current fads. “That red and white outfit shows some impeccable taste. I can’t say I like that she’s a Lancer, though.”

### Scenario Note (Please Read this After Finishing Lostbelt 6)

→Everyone in the Fairy Kingdom thought that she was adopted solely for her use as a tool, which Baobhan Sith herself believed was probably correct. However, the truth was that Morgan did love her as a daughter, and wished for nothing more than her wellbeing.

→Tonelico dispelled Calamities countless times to save Britain. However, taking the righteous, humane path always led to her being battered and abused in the end. Throughout her entire journey, the only one who ever thanked Tonelico was that era’s Baobhan Sith, on the brink of death. She served as Tonelico’s sole light, one that sustained her everytime she was about to crumble.

→With the onset of the Queen’s Calendar, Morgan became the ruler of the Fairy Kingdom. She searched diligently for Baobhan Sith, whose good nature always steered her to death at the hands of fairies who ruthlessly exploited her, and tried to aid her from the shadows by remedying her environment. However, regardless of the methods employed, she’d inevitably be maltreated and face a wretched end, the most extreme case being the Darlington incident. Aware that Baobhan Sith was starting to come apart at the seams, Morgan used her authority as Queen to adopt her, choosing to raise her as her successor. The only path remaining for Baobhan Sith to survive was to become a cruel fairy, though a thorny life it was indeed.

→Ultimately, she lost to Artoria and Chaldea in all their three encounters, and was forced to witness Morgan’s brutal slaughter proceed right in front of her. Hopelessly losing all her authority and standing, she was lynched by the fairies and discarded from the peak of Camelot castle, the throne. The tattered Baobhan Sith was designated as ‘something that must never be touched’, and flung herself into the Great Pit. There lay the corpse of the sealed beast god Cernunnos, who had been murdered by the fairies, and was the cause of Britain becoming a Lostbelt. And then…
