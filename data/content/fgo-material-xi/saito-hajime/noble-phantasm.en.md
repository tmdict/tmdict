Mugyo. A special move by Saito Hajime, the man dubbed the Invincible Sword, who slices from the bottom to the top. This freestyle sword does not employ any specific form.
He approaches the target in a unique way, different than rushing in with pure speed, and his moves distort the target’s perception of time and distance. He then slices up the target in an instant. Since the target assumes they are far enough away that the blade cannot reach them, they are invariably surprised to experience the flurry of cuts.

No matter what kind of melee weapon the target uses, be it spear, sword, or anything else, Saito always makes the first move from any distance, ignoring the target’s reach.

“And that’s why my sword is invincible!”
