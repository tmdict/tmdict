### VR Shinkageryu Hidden Technique: Lazer Blade Dual Wield

  <tr><td>Range</td><td>1</td></tr>

A continuously active Noble Phantasm.
Normally the VR lazer blade is exactly that…VR… As such, it shouldn't function as a real-life sword, but Saber Tomoe Gozen used her own magical energy to create a pseudo-lazer bladed sword to use during her attacks. The sword is, obviously, super hot.

And while Tomoe does not hesitate to claim that this supernatural power was due in part “to the great Asahi Shogun, Lord Yoshinaka,” it is in actuality it's probably from her strong demonic blood. Her sword radiating such heat even in her Second and Third Ascension forms is because of this Noble Phantasm.

### VR Shinkageryu Hidden Technique: Tomoe-ga-Fuchi Taiyo-ken

An Anti-Army attack using the Noble Phantasm mentioned earlier.

“I have awakened to the secret techniques of VR Shinkageryu!” …At least so Tomoe claims, but the truth is unclear. What is clear, though, is that Tomoe puts on a pair of VR goggles to assault the enemy! After she slashes the enemies with both blades, the searing blades draw a circle to create a quasi-sun in the sky that represents her feelings towards Kiso-no-Yoshinaka, and magical bursts outward to finish off the enemy. Tomoe isn't limited to creating one quasi-sun… She can make two, three…even five quasi-suns if she gets serious, but in this game, she will pretty much stick to one.
