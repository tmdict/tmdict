### Voyager of the Storm: C++

A skill employed by captains. This skill is a lower rank than many other captain Servants because Triton was not a sailor, and Nemo’s ship was an advanced technological marvel of his age, so he never had to sail through a howling gale on a tattered vessel. However, if the field is Near Water, this skill’s effectiveness doubles, which explains why its rank is appended with a “++”.

### Indefatigable: B+

The spiritual nature and conviction of Nemo given form. While it’s both a Battle Continuation and NP Gain skill, it has a hidden effect of significantly increasing NP when Guts is activated after reaching HPO (Hit Point Out), as the captain’s spirit burns brightest in the direst of circumstances.

### Guide for Travel: C++

Triton, who once guided the Argo, is known for having been a guide of heroes. As Triton protects the hopes and dreams of those who seek uncharted territory and unknown lands, he is comparable with the young Da Vinci, whose fundamental drive is to go beyond in pursuit of a better world. This skill’s effects also double if the field is Near Water.

### Proof of the Journey: EX

Aronnax Phantasm.

Aronnax is the professor protagonist in “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.” The mechanism is named after his assumption of “a monster with horns” at the beginning of the story.

By adding this mechanism to the Shadow Border, it adds the existence of a “ram-equipped underwater lifeform,” allowing Nemo to unify the Nautilus and the Shadow Border as his Noble Phantasm.

In the alternate world of India, Nemo recognized the courage and pride of the staff of Chaldea, and chose to serve as their captain.

Later, the Nautilus switched from the Shadow Border to the Storm Border as its proof mechanism, becoming the flagship of Chaldea.
