### Personality

Almost the same as normal Illya.
However, due to the swimsuit, she is a little more excited than usual, and her IQ and luck have decreased.
In short, Ilya is in comedy mode. Ilya, whose body and mind have turned to summer, has made it her supreme mission to “play hard during the summer vacation.
It seems that her appetite is slightly off the rails as well as her rationality, and she talks about food a lot.
Basically, she eats anything and thinks everything is delicious!
Ruby is in “Splash Mode,” a hose reel and nozzle form. Although her appearance has changed, she still flies around without permission and is still an annoyance that disturbs the place!
Illya left the class cards in her room.

### Attitude towards Master

Same as normal Illya, but with a more casual feel.
For now I want to put my work aside and have fun with Master.
She’s a little less honour student like and a little more prepared to stay up late.
Whenever she gets tired from playing she suddenly falls asleep.

### Dialogue Examples

llya: “I’m not a magical girl now. I’m just a swimsuit girl”
Illya: “Summer vacation never ends and no matter how much you eat you won’t gain weight. Isn’t being a Servant the best?”
Illya: “’How can everyone be so calm when there’s a murderer!?”

Ruby: “I can serve almost anything watery! I can’t guarantee the effect, though.”
Ruby: “Hmmm, is that a blood trail? Well, let’s give it a squirt of Luminol solution.”
Ruby: “How dare you doubt Ruby-chan! If it was me they would definitely be dead”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Summer! Lake! Camp!
An event that came up right as I was starving for recreation.
I don’t really know what the singularity is or what it’s all about, but it’s a summer camp with a group of friends you love, right? Oh, surely it will be an unforgettable experience.

Unfortunately this time it was a horror story.
And Illya is a scream queen
Surrounded by people who wouldn’t be scared even if a murderer showed up beside them, the only thing she can do is pretend to be brave even if it kills her. Holding back her voice and tears, Illya will surely reach the ending. After all she has the survival flag of “a child in a horror movie”

### General Armaments

Magical Ruby Splash Mode (She has become more annoying now that she sprays watery substances carelessly)

### Connections with Characters

#### Chloe von Einzbern

She was looking at my swimsuit with envy.

#### Miyu Edelfelt

Would you like me to lend you a swimsuit? Obviously it‘ll be a string bikini! I think she‘d respond well to that!

#### Sitonai

That swimsuit, something like that is interesting… No! It‘s nothing!

#### Abigail Williams

Hey! Senpai! I want you to teach me how to be a bad girl so Master can take care of me.
