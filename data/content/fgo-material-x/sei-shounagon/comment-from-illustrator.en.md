Sei Shounagon is a design that carries the concepts of “Heian vs future”, “the best parts of the past”, and “shockingly cute trends”. She’s a character that really got me thinking about what would the real Sei Shounagon like and choose. If you can see what makes her good, feel free to love her, either deeply or the consumerist way. The Noble Phantasm’s face cut-in with the double peace sign and the little tongue sticking out was me intentionally creating the smile capable of defeating everything. (Mika Pikazo)
