Castoria started out with her second ascension design, and then her first and third came along. Her second ascension design was drawn up as a rough sketch during the early stages of the second part [of the game]. When imagining a Caster-class Artoria, the idea that came to mind was “an Artoria sneakily stealing Merlin’s staff and traveling in secret, disguised as a magus”. Both the silhouette, and the pose itself, were almost done already at that point. When it came to formally creating her character, I made her first ascension based on what I saw of her role in the script and such. I also wanted to give her a fitting final stage, so her third ascension had its concept completely revamped, attempting to give her a new design based on “an Artoria who mastered magecraft”. As work on this design progressed, I really did feel like all the different experiences I’d gotten via FGO came together, and it gave me a sort of special emotional attachment to this project.
