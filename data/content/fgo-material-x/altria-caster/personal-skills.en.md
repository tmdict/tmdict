### Charisma of Hope: B

Raised as the Child of Prophecy, Artoria, who set out on her journey, is endowed with a Charisma where people feel like they can depend on and expect things from her. Its effect is similar to the “dreamlike charisma that raises one’s morale” that the mage Merlin utilizes.

### Avalon le Fae: A
A divine protection of the fairies originating from the Inner Sea of the Planet.
A blessing, or perhaps an oath, given by the Child of Prophecy.
The power possessed by a Fairy of Paradise to bless life and protect the target’s karmic power from all sorts of corruption.

### Holy Sword Creation: EX

A Skill which demonstrated to Artoria Caster the way she ought to be to find her way towards her ending.
An Arts version of Merlin’s “Hero Creation”.
Raises Arts performance, grants 1 turn of invincibility (the image of Avalon the scabbard), and grants special attack against a Threat to Humanity.
Once this power has truly awoken, everything that she creates will end up gaining the “sword” attribute.
