### Personality

Obedient and positive. A hardworker who finds joy in running herself ragged for the sake of people she is close to.
She is bright and open-minded and expresses her emotions abundantly.
Matching the age of her manifested appearance, she is a tad bit shy.
From a young age, her beauty was a seed of trouble that would attract scoundrels and evil spirits alike, so she became a withdrawn person. However, when she lost her parents and she was wandering the streets with her siblings, it was also her beauty that granted her the chance to support herself and her family. From that point on, she would take pride in using her appearance as a tool to make people happy.
Her strong points are singing, dancing, and performing on the biwa. She is without equal when it comes to loving hot springs and lychee.

### Attitude towards Master

In her First Ascension, she is like a childhood friend full of charm. In her Second Ascension, she is like a still innocent court lady of the inner palace.
And finally, in her Third Ascension, she is like the bewitching top-rank consort of the pampered Emperor…in such a manner, she frequently changes her expression and behavior.
In particular, when she refers to the Master as “Tenshi-sama”, her eyes are out of focus, as if she is looking at a far-off existence.

### Dialogue Examples

“Hello\~! I’m the Foreigner, Yuuyuu! Please, let me stay by your side forever…
Eh, ah, yes, that’s right, I’m Yang Guifei. I’ll be in your care…so please, don’t call me a country-ruiner\~”
“Yang, yung, yayang, Yang Yuhuan♪ When I smile\~, oh my, Master smiles as well. When Master smiles, everyone smiles and gets lively! This is my most treasured ‘Noble Phantasm’!”
“Burn GO GO!” “Mm\~ lychee’s delish\~♪” “We’ll hold a dance and celebration of victory here!” Yay! Now for the hot spring♪ Hot spring♪”
“You see, I want to remain married to my most important person until the end. This time for sure. That is my wish.”
“I’d like to request you to keep this between us, but when I see strong-willed gentlemen acting as if they were young infants…Umm, how do I put this, it makes me excited…it makes me aroused.”
“Imperial edict! High Priest of Mount Penglai, Yang Taizhen is departing! Release the emperor of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure’s{{n2}} North Gate of the Military Camp{{n3}} and bring here the troops of the Feathered Forest!{{n4}} Ia! Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Fomalhaut n’gha-ghaa naf’lthag! 『Marital Vows of Rainbow Skirts and Feather Robes』!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A peerless beauty counted amongst the Four Beauties and the World’s Three Greatest Beauties.
She became the consort of Xuanzong, the emperor during the glory days of the Tang dynasty which had a history spanning three hundred years.
Xuanzong was Wu Zetian’s grandchild. Their clans may have differed, but Wu Zetian was equivalent to Yang Guifei’s grandmother-in-law.
Before her marriage to Emperor Xuanzong, she became a high-ranking Taoist nun and received the title “Taoist Taizhen”.
In the poet, Bai Juyi’s Song of Everlasting Regret, it is said that “after her death, she became an immortal living in the palace of Mount Penglai, meeting her Emperor who came to visit”.
Her numerous legends have even widely spread throughout Japan, becoming the subject of literary and artistic works.
In later works, it is said that Yang Guifei had lady attendants she was close to in the inner palace called “Hongtao”, “Xie A’man”, “Zhang Yunrong”, “Mama Wang”, “Xu Huozi” and “Niannu” who remained loyal to her even after their deaths.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In order to quell the anger of the soldiers who kept pressing him to execute his beloved consort, claiming that the cause of the rebellion was Yuhuan of the Yang family herself, the Emperor had no choice but to have Yang Guifei decapitated. It is said her grave in the Mawei residential district on the outskirt of the city was later dug up on the Emperor’s orders, but her body was never found.
──────As for the reason why, it’s because Yang Guifei’s karma of ruin and devilish beauty drew the attention of an evil god from outer space and it beckoned to her soul. The many legends left to posterity had also become a source of power for the Servant Yang Guifei.
Having become a fighter, Yang Guifei will serve her Master with all her heart. There is definitely no deception in that. However, there is only a paper-thin difference between the good she does and her madness. Is the Shangdi{{n5}} reflected in her eyes the soul of the emperor or perhaps the firelight of destruction that will turn everything to ashes? Make sure to never let your guard down and watch out for the schemes of the devil lurking in the void.

### General Armaments

The fire spirits (fire vampires) summoned by Yang Guifei transform into the form of her lady attendants or into the shape of ornamental fish, attacking in unison with the musical instrument she plays and her dance signals. Clad in the flames of the evil god, Yang Guifei herself can also carry out blazing attacks as if she were dancing.

### Connections with Characters

#### Wu Zetian

Fuuya Jiějie is my great Emperor’s esteemed grandmother! Even though we are not blood-related, I believe we are a proper family. She works very hard and even managed to become the emperor. When she’s angry, she’s really scary and makes you fear for your life, but that can be quite addictive too… No, no, no, Yuuyuu will also work hard from now on so she will approve of me!
 
#### Qin Shi Huang

The emperor among emperors! Though I say that, I feel ashamed of myself since I do not know everything about that reign of his. The legend that Huaqing Pool, a famous complex of hot springs that I also loved, was created by the great Qin Shi Huang to flirt with a Celestial Maiden, is quite famous. Unexpectedly, we had a connection through hot springs!
 
#### Li Bai

Li Bai-san was a complete drunkard, but he was also an amazing poet and a somewhat elusive personage. It’s about time I ask for his forgiveness for materializing him as “Imaginary Li Bai-san” when I’m dead drunk…just kidding. Please, at least make it clear whether you resent me for the case where you got banished from the imperial court or you’re just having fun teasing me~.
 
#### Abe no Nakamaro

The envoy sent to Tang, Abe no Nakamaro-kun is Li Bai-san’s drinking buddy! E~verything I know about Japan was taught to me by Abe-kun! I see, even though he worked so hard, he couldn’t return to his birthplace… I pray that at least his soul managed to return to Japan.
 
#### Tamamo-no-Mae / Taikoubou / Koyanskaya of Light and Dark

Could it be that I am suspected of being Daji-san’s reincarnation or that I’m someone related to her? I-it’s true that we share the intense common feature of being “country-ruiners”… Yes…I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.
 
#### Kuukai Daishi

The Kuukai Daishi who visited Tang is a very famous personage in Japan known as Koubou Daishi, right? He is the number one Servant this Yuuyuu would want to come to Chaldea! After all, he is an expert when it comes to opening hot springs! …Eh? “Daishi-sama is an existence that has attained immortality so he might not be a Heroic Spirit”? No way~!?
 
#### BB

BB-san is a curious being. My instincts tell me we need to burn her to a crisp with high-calorie genuinely strong flames! …Such a sense of purpose is driving me, but, hmm, I wonder what’s this Nyarl-y sensation? It’s different from when I want to pester Fuuya Jiějie…could it be…a heartfelt feeling of sentiment for a friend?
