Jane shoots a bullet engraved with “Bad Luck”, shooting through the opponent’s head from behind them with a single shot. Even if it is shot right in front of the opponent, this attack will go around and cut in towards them from behind their back without exception. This grants the attack a “certain hit” effect. It is said that the shot opponent will hallucinate playing cards in the makeup of “a two pair that resembles the Aces and Eights of Clubs and Spades” while in the course of their death. It is a special move that causes the same manner of death that “The Champion of the Plains”, “Wild Bill” Hickok – who was Jane’s lover and comrade-in-arms – had suffered to her opponent.

In historical fact, in the town of Deadwood in South Dakota, “Wild Bill” – while in the midst of amusing himself with poker in a bar – was assassinated from behind by Jack McCall. It is said that the cards Hickok held in his hand at that time was a two pair that resembled the Aces and Eights of Clubs and Spades. Thereafter, this black two pair is called the Dead Man’s Hand.

In the Servant Universe, this is Calamity Jane’s 1st Noble Phantasm. Something that served as the foundation for the Assault Protocol Noble Phantasm “Four of a Kind”, which was used by the squad (team) that once defeated “The Primeval Goddess”. It “discovers” the enemy’s weakness(es) before fixing that condition(s) into place as “reality”.
Once “The Primeval Goddess” was defeated, Jane received a curse as a result, causing this Noble Phantasm to be made impossible to use.
