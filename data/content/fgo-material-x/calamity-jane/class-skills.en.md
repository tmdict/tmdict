### Magical Resistance: C

Nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of two verses or below. Cannot nullify large-scale Magecraft such as Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.

### Presence Concealment: A

At first glance, Jane’s appearance and personality totally stand out, but she is indeed a professional scout. If she is serious, she can erase her presence to the extent that people would not even notice her being right in front of them. Because of that, everyone would notice the state of affairs they are in after they realized what she has just done.

### Riding: A

Piloting and remodelling spaceships are also some of Jane’s specialties. Also, she does not hide the fact, but she does not always obtain consent from the owner(s) before remodelling and/or piloting their spaceship(s).

### Independent Action: A+

The ability to remain independent in the present time even when rejecting the Magical Energy supply from one’s Master.
Jane’s overflowing frontier spirit promises her the freedom to act.
