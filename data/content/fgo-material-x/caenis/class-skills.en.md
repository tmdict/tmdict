### Magical Resistance: C

A Skill that nullifies Magecraft spells that were done with a chant of two verses or below. It cannot defend against large-scale Magecraft such as Great Magecrafts and Ritual Spells.

### Madness Enhancement: EX

Caenis, who is the Hero of Tyranny, possesses a special Madness Enhancement on the occasion of this materialization. They normally have reason, but if their anger accumulates and completely goes beyond the limits of their tolerance, they will completely become a storm of spears to the point that trying to come to a mutual understanding with them is absolutely impossible. It is not something at all where they might kill even their Master, but rather they will have the tendency to try to proactively kill their Master in order to end their own materialization.

### Divine Core of the Sea God: B

Caenis the Heroic Spirit originally did not possess a Divine Core, but the Sea God Poseidon bestowed a special grace onto that Spiritual Foundation of theirs. So as a rare exception, the Caenis who is summoned as a Servant possesses a pseudo-Divine Core, and they further possess the Spiritual Status of not a Heroic Spirit Servant, but a Divine Spirit Servant.
