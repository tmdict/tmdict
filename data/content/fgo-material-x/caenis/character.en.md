### Personality

A warrior who keeps anger within themselves.
Something that they hate is the sea.
Something that they hate is the gods.
Caenis has so much anger to the extent that they have Class Aptitude for Avenger. However, one does not sense such a thing from them normally. If they are in a good mood, it seems that they will respond to things cheerfully. Even if they are in a bad mood, if someone talks to them, they will at least respond to them, and would further take the trouble to go along with them with some trifling small talk. They like sweets, so if someone begins to talk about a topic on different kinds of candies, it seems that they will be greatly delighted.

However… if their anger happens to flare up even for a moment, Caenis will become unmanageable. The state of that resulting fury, which does not even make them balk at killing their own Master, can even sometimes compare with a Berserker’s.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Caenis hates the matter of serving others. If their partner is on par with a monarch, they would go through with supplanting them on the spot and decapitate their head, before they would ascend to their throne as an usurper.

It seems that the matter where Caenis was obedient to Kirschtaria Wodime in the end, even while saying this and that towards him… can only be described as an exception among exceptions. The reason is that Caenis, who should be repudiating every monarch, noticed something in regard to his soul.

A Master who has summoned the Divine Spirit Caenis must be careful. They are essentially in a vessel that is not fit to be someone’s subordinate. One had better be always on attention regarding their state of mind.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’m Caenis. My True Name is Caenis, and I’m a Divine Spirit.
————Tsk. What’s with this “I’m Caenis” from me? He has the fucking nerve to mess with me here too.”
“My True Name is Caenis, and I’m a Divine Spirit. It seems that guy said I’m a Lancer. Well, do treat me favourably… Huh? Yo, what, it’s you, huh?! Haha. Whaaat, do you need me after all? Hey, it can’t be helped then; I’ll accompany you!”
“I’m… a Divine Spirit!!”
“There’s no blade, none whatsoever… that can reach me!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

A warrior as well as an usurper who appears in Greek Mythology. Caenis went on an adventure with many heroes as a member of the Argonauts. It has been told that————she was a woman, but later became a man.

It is said that Caenis was once a genuine woman, one who was famous for her beauty and had been praised as a beautiful maiden in Thessaly. She continued to reject numerous marriage proposals, but on some day, she received the love of the Sea God Poseidon (Neptune). Her virginity had been taken away by force. Legends say that the Sea God was satisfied and told Caenis “I will completely fulfill any of your wishes”, and she replied with “Please make me not a woman, so that I will not suffer something like this ever again”; thus, Caenis became an invincible man.

It is unsure whether or not Caenis truly became a man. It is said that after their death, Caenis/Caeneus transformed into a bird that has golden wings and disappeared into the sky, but there is also an anecdote where their corpse that was left behind was that of a woman’s. In either case————Caenis/Caeneus became a robust warrior before that and made a show of ruling the lands as an usurper.

During their lifetime, their name as a man is Caeneus. Caenis is their original name (as a female).

### Character Image in “FateGO”

As a Heroic Spirit, they materialize as a Servant with a feminine figure. Just like the name they had around the time where they had lived as a woman, their True Name is also Caenis.

… It is said that Caenis transformed into “a bird that has golden wings” on the occasion of their death. That anecdote is being provided to them as a Noble Phantasm even in this materialization, but there is a possibility where the special characteristic of “being able to shapeshift their body as they please” that this Noble Phantasm contains can run out of control. It is perhaps that reason why they materialized with a female body and why their body is endowed with animal traits.

When Caenis advances through their Spirit Origin Ascensions, the Divine Protection and Blessing of the Sea God, which is their Noble Phantasm, appears more pronounced, and they attain a form that gets closer to their own self when they were alive. That is to say, they become a shining existence with no equal, a being coiled around with sublime armour, as if they are in the likeness of the Great Sea God Poseidon————It is the figure of “an invulnerable warrior.”

Moreover, as a result of having received a particularly strong grace from Poseidon, Caenis’ Spirit Origin is being constructed into a state where their Spiritual Status has substantially ascended. They no longer fit into the status of a Heroic Spirit… The summoned warrior Caenis has achieved a materialization as a Divine Spirit Servant.

In Part 2 of “Fate/Grand Order”, Caenis appears as one of Kirschtaria Wodime’s Servants. There is a reason why Caenis, who hates, detests and loathes every deity, resolved to serve Wodime to the point of being obedient, and it is not just because of his extraordinary charisma. It is partly because Wodime had personally conveyed to Caenis clearly his own intentions – the truth behind “The Reorganization of the Age of the Gods.”

To change all humans into gods and have the Age of the Gods reorganized————When all is said and done, the gods from the ancient times would all lose their way of being. Of course, that includes the olden Greek gods, as well as the Sea God Poseidon who Caenis treats as the target of their anger!

“That’s excellent, isn’t it? It’s the best way to deal with them!”

Caenis had greatly endorsed Wodime for this.
“If that’s the case, I will certainly wield the Divine Protection and Blessing of the Sea God that this body is endowed with as a Noble Phantasm to my heart’s content!”

### Connections with Characters

#### Jason / Medea / Heracles / Atalanta / The Dioscuri / Asclepius

(Their former travelling companions. Caenis has no need to speak of those fellows, but they do not treat them like strangers either.)

#### Mordred

(A companion Caenis hangs out with in Chaldea. They get along with each other.)

#### Jekyll

(The bean sprout. Caenis does not make active efforts to deal with Jekyll head-on since it is troublesome to do so.)

#### Mandricardo

(Their playmate.)

#### Triton

(Does a double take.) (Does a triple take.)

#### Sakata Kintoki

(Caenis does not take a liking to Kintoki because the latter grew up while being innocent of the ways of the world. In addition, they do not understand well on what his roots are, so they do not take a liking to his inexhaustible nature either.)

#### Martha

(The situation that happens when the two encounter each other is “Oh no, it’s Martha.” Given that Martha is importunate, Caenis runs away whenever they see her face.)

#### Altera

(Caenis’ spine tingles just by seeing Altera’s face. The reason why this happens is unknown to them.)

#### Adult da Vinci

(Da Vinci has been on Caenis’ mind ever since they heard about the details of how————he wanted to change into a woman out of his own accord. As far as they are concerned, they are a being who cannot understand why he/she would do that, but it is for that reason that they find him/her very interesting.)

#### Romulus / Romulus-Quirinus

(It seems Romulus belongs to the same family as the God of War Mars; that is to say, Ares. Caenis subconsciously greets him because Poseidon’s Divine Protection within them is showing his feeling of admiration that says “I see.”)

#### Hyde

(As a matter of fact, they would get along with each other, but given that they rarely come face to face with each other, Caenis is currently bored as a result.)

#### Musashi-chan

(As a matter of fact, they would get along with each other, but————they have not encountered each other in Chaldea even once.)

#### Gogh / (Swimsuit) Sessyoin Kiara

(“The mermaids in Chaldea are kinda… different. Too different, actually.”)
