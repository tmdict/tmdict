When I drew Koyo, I had figures, books, and a dino-loving guy to reference her upper half. Nailing the standing pose for her first Ascension took a lot out of me. It was tough…I fixated on her ascensions, kimono pattern, and general feel a bunch, but ultimately I'm very happy with what I made. (NOCO)
