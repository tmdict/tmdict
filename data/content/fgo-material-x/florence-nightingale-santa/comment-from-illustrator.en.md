When I received the commission for Nightingale (Santa), I was requested to make multiple versions. This Mary Poppins-style Santa was chosen among 3 drafts. I talked to them about wanting to draw the other forms, and as result, I got to draw the nurse version from the candidates in the Final Ascension. (Takahashi Keitarou)
