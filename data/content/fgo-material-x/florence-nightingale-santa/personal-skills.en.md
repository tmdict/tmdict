### Assault Medicine: C+

It’s not a gun.
It is medicine.
The gun-like syringe owned by Archer Nightingale injects a variety of ampoules containing drugs with different effects by shooting them like a long-range weapon. It fires at 20 shots per second.
With a direct hit, the nursing/treatment subject will be healed in a matter of seconds.
With a direct hit, the sterilization/disinfection subject will be eradicated.
It’s a constantly active Noble Phantasm, but it’s displayed as a Skill in-game.

### Nurse of Steel (Christmas): A+

An altered version of the Nurse of Steel Skill she has as a Berserker.

### The Bell the Angel Rings in the Holy Night: EX

Archer Nightingale shows very little interest in the actual event of Christmas, but her modus operandi is deeply connected to the Holy Night.
Her scarlet costume and the golden bell fastened to her traveling bag are proof of that.
Still, she herself has no clue where those came from, she just was like that before she noticed.
