### Personality

(As a Child)

A child with sparkling eyes eager to try new things.

Adventurous (though it feels like he is trying to reverse his original nature of being under ground).

Positive Thinker.

“I’m looking forward to it”

“Ah, what’s that over there”

“Yeah, leave it to me”

(As an Adult)

A young man, a transcendental God Although he appears as a completely cool beauty, it feels as though he is a mumbling airhead.

Has a negative mindset.

He is very aware of his nature as a god of curses, and thinks people should hurry up and bury him again before anything bad happens to them.

“I’m sleepy ugh…”

“You woke me up… How should I punish you?”

“For the sake of the world of man I want to go back to sleep, quickly”

“Is it okay for you to talk to me?”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Doesn’t have any particular wish for the Holy Grail. If forced to pick something it would be the happiness of the person who summoned him. He treats Master as he would any other Master

He is aware that he is not the kind of person who should be in the public eye. He realizes that the situation is so dire that he has to resort to the power of the curse casting god, and he feels that he must fight “to quickly return to the earth”.

### Historical Image · Character Image

Taisui Xingjun, also called Taisaishin is the deified form of Taisai (a hypothetical celestial body thought to be a mirror image of Jupiter, or another name for the planet Jupiter). Taisai is identified with Shìròu, a lump of flesh wriggling in the ground, and is thought to have acquired the properties of a curse casting god from the legend of the lump of flesh, which is said to bring misfortune. Taisaishin is a directional god said to be located in a direction of the twelve signs of the zodiac in a given year, and is believed to be responsible for the good or bad luck of any action performed in that direction.

Also known as Yin Yuanshuai or Yin Tianjun and is said to be the son of King Zhou, Yin Jiao who ascended to godhood. In other words, he is (indirectly) a character from the Investiture of the Gods. In some scriptures, he is depicted as a boy, and there are similarities with Prince Nezha, such as the anecdote of being born from a lump of flesh.

Yin Jiao is the son of King Zhou of Shang’s ex-wife who was killed by Daji and in the Investiture of the Gods he is Daji’s enemy but in other scriptures he is portrayed as helping King Wu of Zhou. What these two descriptions have in common is that he is the enemy of Daji. Incidentally among his treasures is the Bell of Fallen Souls, whose sound makes the enemies’ souls fall off.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

He appeared in the “Water Monster Crisis” event. A special Servant either summoned by Taisai, who floated into the singularity which was a collection of illusions, a “mysterious, shifting waterholes of indescribable location” or by the Kons, a spirit that existed within the singularity who acted as a summoning catalyst.

(As an adult)

Taisui who must not be awakened (dug out), acting as an evil god. He has icy good looks and never changes his facial expressions and always has a downcast look. This state doesn’t last long.

(Normally)

The Kons, intelligent born from the lump of flesh that is Taisui, come together and manifest their divinity. It is as if they were summoned using Taisui itself as a vessel. As a result of a small part of the deity known as Taisui Xingjun was defined independently as an Alter-Ego. He appears as a small boy his basic state as a servant

(Kons)

Unidentified creatures.

They are a lot of them.

During the Singularity, they were seen popping from the ground (Taisui’s main body). Taisui (Shìròu) is sometimes thought to be a type of mushroom called “meat reishi” which may be closely related to rodents. Although consciousness seems to be shared in the group, it seems that each has their own personality and characteristics. Just the right size to hold and nice and soft to the touch. At first it was thought that they couldn’t be brought back to Chaldea but now they are known as “something that can pop out from Taisui Xingjun’s body at a moment’s notice.”
