### Charisma of the Sea Lily: C

The inherent aptitude to win over the women in one’s surroundings to their side (this is also effective on some men).

It reaches the point where Anning’s eccentric and charming personality draws them in, making them cooperate with her without any reluctance.

### Fossil Lady’s Great Discovery: A

The talent to discover things Anning is searching for. This is also useful for reconnaissance.

### Business Acumen: A

The skillful art of conversation in advantageously making progress in business discussions.

Anning’s forte is arousing curiosity in someone about something and making them feel interested in it, even if it is something the other person does not particularly want.
