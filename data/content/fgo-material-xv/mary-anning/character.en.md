### Personality

An arrogant, haughty, impertinent and sarcastic sourpuss. Almost like a delinquent. Anning’s demeanor appears as if her tough side that she had from when she was alive was accentuated when she was transformed into a Servant. Though there are also rumours that say that this personality she displays is almost the same as the one she displayed during her lifetime.

### Attitude towards Master

Anning thinks that her Master should be grateful to her because she is helping them. If their bond deepens, she may… even come to fawn over her Master?

### Dialogue Examples

“Wow, hurray, you… finally drew the winning ticket, you know? You’re glad, right? Hey, the fact is that it’s okay to be even more glad now that I, the most famous and strongest Servant in Europe, have arrived, for it’s as good as you having already won! Don’t you agree?”
“What the heeeck? You… aah, where are you from, you country bumpkin!?”
“Hey, I’ll show you… the Jurassic Coast.”
“Come on… there’s nothing but really cute girls here… Are all of these yours? Seriously… that’s amazing, I must say…”

### Historical Image · Character Image

An aloof fossil collector who no one in the paleontology world does not know of. Anning was born into and raised by a poor family living in the seaside town of Lyme Regis. She excavated fossils together with her family from when she was a child and had chosen to sell them to supplement her family finances, but she gathered attention when she found an ichthyosaurus fossil at the tender age of 13.{{n2}} Afterwards, she dug out more various valuable fossils and personally sold them to scholars and aristocrats. She spent most of her life excavating fossils in her hometown.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Anning was merely an ordinary person of culture who has nothing to do with Mystery, so it is unclear why she was summoned into the Lancer Class.

It may be because she grew up in a rough-mannered environment, but Anning has a terribly sharp and nasty tongue. She will also happen to make indecent statements. She is somewhat quick to fight, and she will gladly accept a fight without reservations if she was provoked into one by someone. Though she will not bully the weak. She will slightly glare at a person she meets for the first time right away, but she will immediately surrender against a person who is just too scary to her. She grew accustomed to solitude, yet she is lonely too. She favourably comes into contact with people who acknowledge her and takes great care of her. She is abundant in kindness, and she repays her debts of gratitude without fail.

Anning’s self-esteem being high is the opposite of her inferiority complex. She has high pride. She likes to stand in a stronger position over others and immediately assert dominance. She rarely apologizes even if she is at fault. Although she always behaves like herself, she will even butter up unpleasant fellows if it is for the sake of gaining profits. Another forte of hers is feigning friendliness and cuteness.

Anning holds an inferiority complex for being born and raised in the countryside. Because she has been despised as an oddball by many of the locals during her lifetime, she has hardly any love for her hometown. But if it turns into a bragging contest about one’s hometown’s countryside, she will speak with staggering zeal. She hates being seen as the same as the ignorant bumpkins in her hometown. She regards herself as a person of importance, and as the wisest and classiest person in her hometown. She is also boastful about the connections she has with prominent scholars and aristocrats. Even this sort of small-mindedness from her is cute.

Anning does not care about one’s sex regarding her object of romantic interest. Although she dreams of marrying a good-looking aristocrat and gaining money and social status as a result from marrying such a rich and powerful man, she loves cute young women too. She will vigorously move towards someone she has fallen in love with, but as a matter of fact, given that she has a pure heart, she would be shy if someone vigorously moves towards her on the contrary.

### General Armaments

A hammer used for excavations.
Electric shocks generated from inside her body (this is based on the anecdote from when she was alive where she was swallowed up by a lightning strike during her early childhood and survived).
Familiars modelled after extinct animals.
Her beloved dog.

### Connections with Characters

#### Tray

Anning’s beloved dog who she treated very tenderly during their lifetimes. The one she is with now is like a familiar that reproduced the form of her beloved dog, but there is no difference in how adorable it is.

#### Artoria Pendragon

Anning blathers on about that good-looking guy…

#### Nikola Tesla

As they are both electric-type Servants, Anning has a sense of rivalry with Tesla.
