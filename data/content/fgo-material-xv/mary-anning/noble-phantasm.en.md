### Duria Antiquior: Dorset Coast from a Past Period

Anning summons her familiars that are modelled after extinct animals and unleashes them all at once towards her enemies. Really, her expectation is that a cool Noble Phantasm would have been ideal for her, something like recreating the sea from the Jurassic Period with a Reality Marble, but because of her low status as a Heroic Spirit, this is her limit.

Every creature that hastens to join Anning include the long-necked reptiles (plesiosauruses), winged reptiles (dimorphodons), snake stones (ammonites), arrow stones (belemnites), and, in addition, her beloved dog Tray.{{n2}} Anning has a deep connection to all of them during her lifetime.
