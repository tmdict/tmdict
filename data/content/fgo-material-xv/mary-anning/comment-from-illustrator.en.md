I intended to aim for a moderately deformed fashion of Miss Anning, like making her into an anime character within the World Masterpiece Theater, while being aware of her actual appearance. Overall, I may have made her rather plainâ€¦ Depending on her Ascension, it may have been even better to choose a more flashy attire for her to make her seem even more like a Servant. (Lyot)
