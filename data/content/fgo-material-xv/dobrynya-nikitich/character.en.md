### Personality

A young warrior who is brazen and full of self-confidence. Nikitich’s catchphrase is “I can do it.” It seems that she can do almost all things.

Nikitich is not very talkative on her part, but her whole body is overflowing with the strong conviction of “There’s not that much things that can’t be done by me, don’t you agree?” Although she is in an area where there is a paper-thin difference between overflowing with that conviction and being prone to overconfidence, there is a difference from the common display of overconfidence in that she also has the presence of mind to know that “If it’s something I can’t do, then I can’t do it.”

Nikitich is quick to make decisions. As a matter of fact, she really does not hesitate to decide. Once she decides on something, she will immediately take action, so because of that, she is not very fit for acting as part of a group. And because of that, in the case that this happens while she is acting as part of a group, she would entrust everything to her King or commander while she herself would try to not think very much about that act. (It also seems like she is prone to being in a daze.)

Since she is full of self-confidence and excels in decisiveness, Nikitich has a temperament suited for independent action as one would expect. It seems possible to say that she is a Heroic Spirit suited for solo adventures and independent scouting duties.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Once she understands the structure of Master and Servant, Nikitich will come into contact with her Master in a friendly way. From the way it seems, within Nikitich’s inner thoughts, she has a perception of “I see, I can say with confidence that for someone called the Master, they’re like my beloved horse, right?” Of course, from the standpoint of Nikitich, her beloved horse is a one-of-a-kind existence, her adventure companion, something that she can have a conversation with at times (Nikitich’s horse can talk), and a subject she takes great care of.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’m Rider, Dobrynya Nikitich.”
“Call me Dobrynya or Nikitich, whichever you like.”
“I can do it.”
“Monarch of the Sun, bear witness!”
“Come on now, Master, let’s go. To an adventure; to battle!”

### Historical Image · Character Image

One of the Bogatyrs (Heroes) – warriors that were spoken of in the Bylinas, which were epic poems about Russia’s Heroes. A Dragon Slayer.

Even among the brave warriors who served the legendary “Monarch of the Sun” – Vladimir the Grand Prince of Kyiv, Nikitich is a young able-bodied warrior who was called the second strongest brave, ranked only next to the strongest brave among them, Muromets. He is known for the anecdote of exterminating Zmey Gorynych – a wicked three-headed dragon – and rescuing a Princess of Kyiv in the process; the anecdote that is related to his wife Nastasia; and so forth.

<>

According to the Bylinas————Dobrynya Nikitich was born to a noble family, and under the love of his mother, who was a widow, he was raised into a graceful youngster. Regarding Nikitich, there were three taboos he must not violate, but… driven by a sense of adventure, he took out his Damask Steel armaments, violated the taboos one by one, and had all sorts of adventures unfold before him. Eventually, he surprisingly defeated the three-headed dragon Zmey Gorynych even over a span of two fights, and at the time of triumphing over the dragon a second time, he rescued Princess Zabava, a niece of the Grand Prince of Kyiv.

And as a reward for exterminating the dragon, he could have the princess as his wife————but Dobrynya Nikitich never had a desire for that.

The name of the woman Nikitich would eventually take as his spouse is Nastasia. She is said to be either “Nastasia Mikulishna” – a daughter of the Russian Hero and Giant Mikula Selyaninovich, or “Nastasia Nikulichna” – his young wife known in the legends for devotedly waiting for her husband’s return.

In an anecdote regarding the Mikulishna version, after fighting with the three-headed dragon Zmey Gorynych, Nikitich was also defeated in a duel with the Giantess and Heroine Nastasia, and he was put away in her pouch as a result. After that, he and Nastasia would arrive at a decision to marry each other.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

In folklore, Nikitich is a male. Even the person herself here says “Nikitich is a man.” However, that materialized form————appears to be female. When one points out that matter of discrepancy, she will spring back with a response of “Well, it’s true you know.”

<>

The legendary Nikitich is not a female. He is a male. But why is this materialized Rider, Dobrynya Nikitich, a female? The person herself is silent and does not speak of this matter of discrepancy. At this point, a certain Chaldean personnel came up with three hypotheses.

The first theory: “The legend and the reality of the past are different from each other, just like the case with the Heroic Spirit Artoria, who is known as the Knight King Arthur Pendragon.”
It is a simple and clear theory.

The second theory: “Is the insuppressible evil nature of the wicked Dragon Kin Zmey Gorynych, who is being contained within the form of a Noble Phantasm, corrupting his Spiritual Foundation in the form of a hex?”
It is a conceivable circumstance.

The third theory: “It is not Nikitich himself, but his wife Nastasia (in this work, Nastasia is being treated as someone who has the characteristics of both her Mikulishna and Nikulichna versions) who is materializing into this masqueraded state in order to hide her True Name. In that case, perhaps Nastasia was concerned about her youthful and courteous husband Nikitich materializing and becoming popular with the opposite sex, or perhaps there was some trouble on the side of Chaldea’s summoning method…”
There are many reasons and so forth to be taken into consideration for this case.

Although each of those theories have some degree of persuasiveness behind them, what exactly is true and what is false is unknown. But at least the Heroic Spirit Dobrynya Nikitich here is conducting herself as that distinguished Dragon-Slaying Hero Dobrynya Nikitich.

### Nikitich in “Tunguska Sanctuary”

————How… could a Heroic Spirit materialize then and there?
Was it something resembling an incarnation of the Counter Force?
Was it something resembling a miracle of some kind?
Was it something resembling a summoning ritual of some sort, similar to those of a Holy Grail War?

At any rate, because the person herself does not speak of it, the truth of it is unknown, but there is a possibility that Dobrynya Nikitich, or this Heroic Spirit who calls herself Dobrynya Nikitich, had visited the actual location of the Tunguska Event in 1908 immediately following the explosion. Thereupon, it is said that this Heroic Spirit gave a name to the Juvenile Beast who had just come into existence as a lifeform.

That name… is Yaskaya.

If this theory is the truth, then it will probably turn out that it was surely this Heroic Spirit who is the godparent of the “Koyanskaya” part of the name… Tamamo Vitch Koyanskaya, who became a likeness of the Golden White Face, an Evil of Humanity who possesses nine tails.

<>

In any case, the Nikitich in Chaldea cares about Koyanskaya. It seems that she is thinking about wanting to get along with them well if there is a chance, and yet————

### Connections with Characters

#### Georgius

A Dragon Slayer comrade. Nikitich has a feeling of kinship with Georgius, and admires him.

#### Martha

A figure Nikitich ought to love and respect.

#### Odysseus

Nikitich has a feeling of kinship with Odyseeus. It is said that Nikitich possesses a legend that originated from a legend of Odysseus.

#### Anastasia

Nikitich has a feeling of kinship with Anastasia.

“It’s like the beauty of the northern lands has taken form as that princess…”

#### Artoria

“King Arthur was a woman!” Here is Nikitich who cannot hide her astonishment.

#### Arthur

“… Ehh? His smell greatly takes after the King Arthur from over there, but… hmm?”

#### Koyanskaya of Light / Koyanskaya of Darkness

“Yaskaya, ah, my dear Yaskayas! Theeere are two of them!”

… In this way, this event marks the moment where Nikitich met Yaskaya for the third time. She does not understand the reason why, but she is filled with emotion when she meets the two Yaskayas. Upon understanding that this event is just an ephemeral moment, and that she is a hollow shadow figure, Nikitich believes that she must at least fill this small moment with her love.
