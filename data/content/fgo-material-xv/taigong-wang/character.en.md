### Personality

An attractive and absent-minded tactician. Smiles by default.

Completely unaware of his best qualities, in special his unique charisma that brings people together. This makes a lot of people like him and a lot of people hate him. Conversely, his highly aware of his good luck.

He firmly believes that in most matters, including war, the more prepared side wins most of the time, but he understands that occasionally, a minor stroke of luck or individual talents can turn the tides. For that reason, he doesn’t take chances. He never overestimates his own luck. He puts effort in his stratagems, raises powerful armies, and always expects the opponent to be slightly luckier and more naturally talented than himself.

However, he considers fishing to be 100% a matter of luck. “It’s all luck. ALL, I tell you.”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Apparently, from the moment of his manifestation, he decided to treat his Master like a fishing buddy. But nonetheless…

“Sometimes, I just feel like showing off, you know?”

The comment above was made immediately after conquering a Micro-Singularity. Finding the right opportunity, he might try focusing on looking cool, or so he says. Although Huang Feihu and Nezha asked what he meant, Taigong only gave them an ambiguous smile.

### Dialogue Examples

“I’m hereby manifested in a Rider Saint Graph. My True Name is Taigong Wang.”

“Oh, but I don’t mind if you prefer calling me Lu Shang, Jiang Ziya, or Jiang Taigong.”

“You’re up against a Taoist. Don’t you think you can win easily.”

“I’m quite competent.”

“Let me try.”

“Don’t bother with the complicated stuff.” (Says this one a lot. He’s a thinker, but when it really counts, he’s driven more by his emotions.)

### Historical Image · Character Image

fishing on the north coast of the Weihe, a branch of the Yellow River, he met with King Wen of Zhou (Xi Bochang). King Wen declared he was the sage that the previous rulers of Zhou wished for, and accordingly started calling him by the title of Taigong Wang (meaning “my father’s wish”).

He helped King Wen and his Royal General, putting high effort into toppling the Yin Dynasty. His successes award him the title of Ruler of Qi, making him the founder of the Qi kingdom from the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States period. He’s also known as Shi Shangfu, Jiang Taigong, or Jiang Ziya.

In the Ming Dynasty novel Investiture of the Gods, he’s portrayed as a Taoist: a being with paranormal abilities. “Man, what a shame. If I were summoned as a Caster, I’m sure I could have made it Grand Caster.”, or so he claims.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

A general and the tactician of Zhou, and a disciple of Yuanshi Tianzun. A Taoist. He carried out a grand deicide (homicide) plot that unfolded in the background of ancient China’s Yin Dynasty insurrections, bringing collateral damage to both Xian and human realms. That was the Investiture.

Ultimately, as history tells, he helped King Wen and his Royal General, commanded the troops as a tactician despite being a Taoist, and served the cause of toppling the Yin Dynasty. Later he founded the kingdom of Qi.

### Taigong Wang in “Tunguska Sanctuary”

In his Tunguska manifestation, he was motivated to meet Daji again in his Daji hunt, but to everyone’s surprise, Koyanskaya was a completely different person. Taigong Wang didn’t express any opinions about it. He didn’t say if he was disappointed or relieved. All he had was an ambiguous smile. Nikitich pressed him to apologize for his mistaken conjecture, but he stayed resolutely smiling without a word.

The past contains no records of a romance between Taigong Wang and Daji. As told in The Investiture of the Gods, he defeated Daji and brought the Yin Dynasty to the end of its days. All companions fighting alongside him would unanimously say the thought of Daji seducing Taigong is not plausible.

They’re correct, she didn’t seduce him. On the contrary, Daji hated him, and he ultimately defeated her with his own hands.

“Seducing me? No, she’d never. She’d kill you if she ever heard you say that. It’s just that, you know… She was beautiful. That’s the one undeniable fact.”

### Connections with Characters

#### Huang Feihu / Nezha

Family. Friends for the longest time. No drink tastes the better than the one served amidst nostalgic chatter.

#### Tamamo no Mae

Shock. Upon seeing her turning a corner in the hallways, the resemblance made him reflexively utter “Daji!?”.

#### Tamamo Cat

Relief. Despite the outward quirks, he would never mistake this one for anyone else.

#### Koyanskaya of Dark / Koyanskaya of Light

Remorse and worry. He still feels bad for mistaking her for someone unrelated. The worry part is about her getting two Saint Graph in her manifestation.

#### Zhuge Liang / Sima Yi

Curiosity. 30% interest in the tacticians who use fangshi, 70% interest in the people living in the present.

#### Odysseus

Resignation. When competing in chess, backgammon, shogi, and the space marine game, he caught a glimpse of the man’s competence as a strategist and tactician.

#### Kiichi Hougen

Amazement. He heard she deciphered the ultimate strategies he encrypted into the Three Strategies’ text. And then she let the deciphered techniques get stolen? That’s also impressive!

#### Nikitich

Acceptance. She probably figured out a lot of his secrets.

#### Merlin

Empathy. He relates to him in every level, but believes himself to be not THAT bad.

#### Abe no Seimei

“… Agh, I really can’t get a good read on him. C’mon, don’t play dirty like that.”
