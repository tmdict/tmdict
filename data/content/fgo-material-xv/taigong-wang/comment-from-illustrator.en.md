If I recall correctly, the prompt was “a bum who, unlike Merlin, doesn’t realize he’s a bum”. I thought a good visual identity for that would be someone who has serious conversations through a grin that makes them less believable, so I drew him with a constant smile on his face, if memory serves me right. I could predict he’d have at least one meathead moment, so I designed the God-Striking Whip to look as painful as a blunt weapon can get. My favorite part of the profile I received is where it says he doesn’t consider Sibuxiang a dragon. Being Sibuxiang must be stressful. (oyo)
