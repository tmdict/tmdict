He has a Thought Key from the Far East’s Thought Magecraft, which is completely different from Western Magecraft. He uses this Key for what he calls Xian Arts and Fangshi (Tao Arts). He’s a figure from the 1000s BC, and has access even to the Privileged Domains of the Thought Foundation, so the magecraft he uses should be called Thought Magecraft from the Age of Gods.
