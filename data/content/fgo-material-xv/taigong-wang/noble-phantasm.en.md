A Divine Beast. Taigong Wang’s mount in the Investiture of the Gods. The other Xians say our buddy Sibuxiang is a species of dragon, but Taigong’s words on the matter are “No way I’d be able to ride him if he were a dragon”.

He’s a constantly active Mount Noble Phantasm. He can cover himself in a gigantic cover of magical energy as dragons do, shapeshift, fly, and sometimes even burn down the enemy troops. In Fate/Grand Order, he does shapeshift and attack but doesn’t get to use the Anti-Army Annihilation-level power that comes with his True Name release.

The whip to strike gods. This Noble Phantasm is thought to be the source of his Investiture Enforcer Skill. It used to have a limited number of uses, but when manifested as Heroic Spirit, this restriction is apparently gone.

When its True Name is released, a supersized God-Striking Whip falls from the sky, piercing the land along with the enemy. Taigong claims such is the might of a Noble Phantasm called by name, but it’s possible that he’s unleashing a Shenxian-level magecraft attack by using his Thought Key to momentarily connect to the Privileged Domains of his Thought Foundation.

Another possibility to be evaluated is that he’s borrowing power from his Shenxian self, as he turned into one at the end of his training. If that is actually the case, then Rider Taigong Wang is a Servantfied partition of a Shenxian, the original Taigong Wang, just pretending to have come from the Throne of Heroes.

So, what IS the correct answer? Unfortunately, Taigong Wang refuses to say. It may well be that he doesn’t know, either.
