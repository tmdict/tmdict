### Dominator Fox: A

The Authority to improve domination systems and domesticate all animals (including humans)... or so she claims with the most apathetic expression. It’s actually just a hobby and an instinct of hers. Control through management, basically.

### Slaughter Beasts: A

An alteration on Tamamovitch Koyanskaya’s Aptitude for Slaughter (Human) Skill. An Aptitude for Slaughter specialized in manipulating animals. She exerts absolute control over any beast with hair and a tail, regardless of Magical Beast, Mythical Beast, or Divine Beast rank, and employs them as perfected weapons. That said, she can’t completely force especially powerful Divine Beasts into submission, so this Skill does only the “improving their power” part. ATK+ to self, ATK+ and DEF+ to part members with beastly attributes.

### Goddess Morph (Beast): B

The top level of the Morph Skill. She transforms into her Koyanskaya Tamer mode (it doesn’t change her appearance!). Invul Pierce to self + alters field into a Shang Hell. Curse, Burn, and Poison go one rank higher while the field is Shang Hell. In the Shang Hell, men are degraded to beasts, lose their intellect, and suffer more the deeper this loss was. A hellish picture that can be considered a reproduction of King Zhou of Shang being corrupted by the Wine Pool and Meat Forest. Nicknamed Shang’s Blood Alter (Ingoku Danchi). A Skill that sorta discloses the past of crimes of Koyanskaya’s model Tamamo no Mae but sorta doesn’t.
