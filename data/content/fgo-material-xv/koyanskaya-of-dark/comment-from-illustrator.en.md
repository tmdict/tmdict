The prompt was “from competent secretary to sexy beast tamer to anima-miko”, so I tried to envision a priestess to a god of the sun and beasts for the 3rd Ascension. I nailed making her feet look like she dashes fast!!!!!!!!!!! Look at how many expressions I drew\~\~ Always a great time drawing tons of Koyanskaya evil faces\~\~!!! I designed her and Koyan of Light at the same time, but there’s no obvious parallels to them, as this impression of duality was something I was actively trying to avoid. (Wada Arco)

#### Koyan Tank

I was selected for the job of designing this Noble Phantasm through Ms. Wada Arco’s recommendation. Thanks to Ms. Wada’s precise and detailed instructions, the designing process flowed smoothly without a moment of indecision. While I utilized blueprints from real-life weapons very liberally, my attention was centrally on making Koyanskaya look appealing on it. The chassis color was another aspect chosen by Ms. Wada. It was an idea that would never have come from my own head, and I believe hearing her suggestion there opened my third eye. I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to work in a such a wonderful game. Thank you. (Katagai Fumihiro)
