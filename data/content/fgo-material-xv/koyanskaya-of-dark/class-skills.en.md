### NFF Services: EX

A Koyanskaya-original Skill, part of her plot to become a new Konjiki Hakumen. The ability to turn those not allowed to exist (ungodly beings, the ones rejected by Pan-Human History) into her reliable workers. The perfect Authority for the next-generation Great Specter.

Sounds amazing on paper, but it’s just basic Familiar Construction. She can absorb any haired creature into her tails’ library, and generate and control them as new familiars. Koyanskaya planned to become the queen of the Lostbelt-exclusive abominations, just like the Nine-Tailed Fox was the general administrator of the pipe foxes.

### Entity of the Outer Realm: C

Since this version of Beast IV originated from a meteor crashing on Earth, she has the Authority to connect with the sector of the universe that is her origin. This Skill is a side-product of that Authority. It’s different in nature from the version the outer space Foreigners have.

### Nega-Self: C

The Authority to negate the ego and self-awareness originating from animals. The Beast of Domestication used her own cells to generate and release the animals she absorbed, but to forbid them from crossbreeding and creating lineages and family trees, she went a step beyond and disallow them to be aware of their biology altogether. Life subservient to her is forbidden to evolve by physical growth, experience gain, or genetic mixture.
