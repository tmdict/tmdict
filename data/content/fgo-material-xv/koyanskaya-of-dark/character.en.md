### Setting

One of the two Koyanskayas split off during Lostbelt: Beast IV’s investiture. Koyanskaya of Darkness. She’s now more wicked than she was when posing as an apostle of the Alien God. She mocks Human Order and is harsh on humanity. Her aspects as a Tamamo no Mae with no desire to be a good wife (ignore the point that she’s not really Tamamo no Mae for a moment), a destroyer, and an evil (nature) spirit are stronger.

A Beast is an evil born from the karma produced by humanity’s progress, and Koyanskaya, as a previous Beast IV candidate, is no exception. Within our categories of beings oppressed/persecuted by humanity and beings used by humanity for oppression/persecution, this version of Koyanskaya falls under the “persecuted” side… Simply put, she became a Demon employing ungodly beasts.

She has the right to become the head for the animals born in humanity’s ecospheres (actual ecospheres, and their imaginary creations) and the Authority to wield them at their maximum capacity. Her attribute is darkness, but unlike Koyanskaya of Light, she loves humans. However, she expresses her love through mistreatment, predation, and taming. Due to this love, she has no will to eliminate humans. Her only wish is to make their lives more and more luxurious, and them even more obedient.

An arbiter made from an amalgam of the animal’s complaints. While she’s a pseudo-deified retaliation mechanism of the natural world, she is awfully flexible in pushing for her preferences over duties (expressed through reminders that humans are also animals), probably due to being modeled after Tamamo no Mae.

Also, despite the symmetry she has with Koyanskaya of Light as beings of opposite natures, they have one thing in common. No matter how much she gains enmity against humanity and loses her marriage aspirations, Tamamo no Mae’s servile nature never goes away.

### Personality

(1st~2nd Ascension)

A captivating beauty who cruelly and bewitchingly leads humans around by the nose, following her policies of strict and dominating wildness. Her management system is to oppose the strong (defeat them and make them fall to the weak status) and shower the weak with affection. Truly the stance of a queen/boss of the animals. She’s a cruel beauty, but she doesn’t see love affairs as unnecessary. In her own words, “it’s because of my wildness that I value my affection (read: instincts)”.

She’s ruthless and cruel by nature, but on the outside, she enjoys playing the role of an intellectual and competent woman. She has a taste for sadism and torments the weak as a hobby, but that’s just a beast’s nature of “the weak feed the strong” leaking out of the mask. She never forgets the playfulness that comes with forcing total obedience on the weak.

“Being earnest about driving the human race to extinction is not a good look, is it? If I must crush you, then I at least need to have fun doing it. You humans will die in my games. ♡”

Due to this “have fun with everything you do” personality shown above, her attacks on humanity are very roundabout. She came up with many plans to pressure humanity, but ultimately reached the conclusion that everyone would be happier with her as an ultimate figure of strength raising them as pets, choosing the path to become the perfect Goddess of Domestication to corner humanity.

(3rd Ascension)

Raiten Nikko, Honosumeragi-no-Hime-no-Kami. The Flame Empress Goddess of Hubris Starlight. Koyanskaya’s usual form is reversed, giving her the more solemn behavior and personality of a nature spirit… except nothing changes on the inside. If anything, she gets more placid (the greater Saint Graph scale made her less cautious).

While she’s a cold-hearted ruler, she is also a goddess who emphasizes wildness, prioritizing her personal feelings over the bigger picture. She tones down on the overly formal secretary speech, behaving more straightforwardly as a primitive beast. The raw text of her dialogue makes her seem like a Tamamo no Mae + Cat combo, but note that she still retains Koyanskaya’s elegance and stubbornness.

### Attitude towards Contractor

She loves humans, so she’d never plot to slight or ruin her contractor. Koyanskaya simply serves her contractor abiding by her own affections, and it results in them forgetting their humanity.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Chaldea’s Master is a suppression target, but she never forgets she’s grateful for them saving her. That’s because animals don’t change their creeds depending on who they’re talking to. She’s not a Servant allied to Chaldea (humanity), she’s a Servant allied to Chaldea’s Master. If Chaldea’s Master dies, she’ll quickly either vanish or return to being an enemy of humanity.

### Dialogue Examples

Hello, thanks for dialing the NFF Call Center♡ Servant, Foreigner, Tamamovitch Koyanskaya. I heard your request and am taking up the post. Oh, you say I’d never help you? Perish the thought. You humans are practically my playthings. I’ll do everything in my power to preserve you. Besides, being earnest about driving the human race to extinction is not a good look, is it?

I may have responded to your summons, but do not forget I am still just an employee on contract, loyal only to NFF Services. I may have called out my plan to build my own primacy ecosphere, but my policies remain the same.

I retain my beasthood as a god and become the god of the beasts. You’ve witnessed the advent of Raiten Nikko, Honosumeragi-no-Hime-no-Kami, Flame Empress Goddess of Hubris Starlight, the malignant star dropping eternal darkness, in a Nation Dispelling mirroring Izanagi’s Nation Creation. Now I’ll crush all under my feet and make them my thralls!

Count one: let there be signs in the emptiness. Count five: the shooting star draws in the kings. Count nine: the Great Specter pierces the land. Raiten Nikko - Maganeboshi Rakka Ryuusui.

My sincerest apologies. I have other matters to attend to, so I must take my leave. You will one day regret what you’ve done.

### Connections with Characters

#### Tamamo-no-Mae

Tamamo no Mae? A Divine Spirit calling herself a piece of the sun? I was born from the vestiges she left in history and awakened for a different purpose. We are 80% not the same person, if a Tamamo were to be called a person. To be more specific, I’m a next-generation Tamamo no Mae. If she is mikon 1.0, then I am mikon 2.5. A mikon with all functions updated to the current era.

#### Taigong Wang

Do I smell Taigong Wang? Unforgivable! I can dismiss other beast hunters as mere savages, but that man alone is unforgivable! I shall pluck his unnecessarily long limbs and enshrine his beheaded handsome face in my finest tomb!

#### Beni-Enma (Alter)

BENI♡ (smooch smooch) Earnest! Pure! Gullible! AH, you’re built all with parts I like. Feel free to build your nest on my hat! Hm, she escaped again. Why does my embrace make Lady Beni-Enma so uncomfortable? What’s with this blank stare. Don’t tell me you found a flaw in my approach!?

#### Sesshouin Kiara

Many humans reached godhood, but I didn’t think I’d see the day I’d meet a human who surpassed godhood. Wait, I have a bigger question. What the HELL is wrong with mental composition? Not even a 4D cube’d be enough to give us a good visual representation of that. Who had the big idea of letting her build a universe inside her belly?

#### Draco

Someone, after becoming a fully-grown Beast, took to the side of humanity without having to be defeated, huh. Evils of Humanity and Love for Humanity have always been linked together. If someone were to triumph over the Logos of Lapse, it makes perfect sense that its Beast would find new hope beyond it… That said, I consider this lady’s love a tad more overbearing than your average Beast.

#### Summer Chloe

An editor becoming a tropical beast god? Hohoho, who was supposed to believe such ridiculous tale? Are you sure haven’t drunk an energy drink can too many?

#### Edison

EDISON! A gorgeous man of the wild, possessing extraordinary industrial power while also boasting the king’s mane. There’s no other way to interpret this hideous combination: this is an affront to me! He combines both my Light and my Darkness. There are no other alternatives, I must take legal action immediately.
