### Rebellion Charisma: B-

An innate ability to command army corps. It helps elevate the team’s abilities within team combat.
However, the Trung Sisters’ rebellion was suppressed in 3 years.
This is due to the reports stating that the cause of their defeat was due to the spread of war weariness among allied generals and diminished morale during confrontation against the punitive forces of the Eastern Han Dynasty.
Trung Trac’s charisma functions flawlessly as a symbolic leader regarding country management, but as supreme commander of an army, its rank slightly decreases.

### Sisters’ Bond: A

A skill that demonstrates the bond of two sisters who overtly rebelled against the mighty Chinese, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi.
They love each other, they cherish each other, they want to be together.
Both of them will always hold each other’s hand.
—-They will hold it until the very end.

### Trung Thanh Vuong: EX

This skill demonstrates that Trung Trac, who has taken on the title as queen, has accumulated faith as a God named Trung Thanh Vuong.
After the rebellion had been decimated, people continued to bring up their names and eventually, they were worshiped as deities of fortune.
Regarding “Ghosts of Vietnam”, a 14th century classical Chinese collection of stories, it is a collection of tales about Vietnamese Gods which has documented that people have prayed during a great drought during the Ly Dynasty era, and the sisters bestowed them rain in response.
