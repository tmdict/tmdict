I really wanted to make the sisters look like one so I drew their respective slit ao dai and put their respective key color on each others’ fingertip. For the Final Ascension, I had a lot of fun doing whatever I wanted like making their eyes glow, having a shadow fall on their faces at all the time, and other scary elements. The request I got described something like “charging forward on an elephant”, so I wanted them to appear in a way where they can be on the screen as well, so that led me to this insane idea of…when the two combine, they become really huge. I really love how the elephants’ hooves turn gold as they ascend. (Take)
