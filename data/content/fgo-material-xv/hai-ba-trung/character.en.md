### Personality

The eldest sister, Trung Trac, wore the title of Queen Trung and was the commander of the rebellion army.
She was constantly very composed and collected, smartly looked ahead, listened to her subordinates’ reports and made every rational decision for them.
However, she was a strong and worthy leader who possessed a motherly nature and an unforgettable humane kindness.
Her current appearance as a Servant is relatively young, but her personality remains unaffected.

“Understood. Thank you for your efforts, please fall back.”
“That won’t work. Let’s send our soldiers that way.”

…Though, that is just her demeanor.
To only her trusted younger sister, who she loves very much, does he let out a bellowing expression and a sigh.

“Nhi-chan, help me~~. Your sister is so tired today~” (Growling) 
“Haah. I wonder why everyone keeps giving such harsh demands…”

When she senses someone is coming, she will abruptly stand up and have her perfect administrator face on.
“What’s happening? Give me your report”
“Y-yes, ma’am”
In truth, many of her subordinates were already aware of this and pretended not to notice. She leads an army as a flag bearer not because she desires to, but it is her sense of duty as her kindness in wanting to save her people and country, and wish to fulfill her role is why she wears the mask of a perfect leader…and they are fully aware of this fact. They pretend not to notice because it is natural to relax in the presence of family, and they want her to relax comfortably in her own way.
She has not lost this habit even after becoming a Servant, but Master is very aware of this.

Trung Nhi is the younger sister who supports her older sister by being her close aide.
She doesn’t change her facial expressions much, but she has a presence similar to that of a cool taciturn professional. When strangers look at her, they think, “she must be in charge of assassinations and other foul missions….”
However, she really loves her older sister. She’s more like a siscon.
Her wish to help her sister is her only behavioral principle.
In public, she would only call her “Elder sister”, but when they’re both alone and relaxed, she would call her “big sis”.
Even when she deeply wants to say “Sis is so pretty”, her face remains scary which is why people would often misunderstand her.
Trac is the only one who can perfectly perceive her younger sister’s expressions and feelings.
But it’s not just her older sister she likes, it’s cute things in general.

“Big si…elder sister. Lay out your orders”
“I will do everything to eliminate anything that makes you sad”
(Ahh, I just want to give my adorable sis who’s rolling around a big big hug so badly…)

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

They do not have a particular wish for the Holy Grail. Their purpose is to help those who are suffering.
They treat Master as any other Master.

However, they both put pressure on them by saying, “I don’t care what happens to me, but I won’t forgive you if you hurt my little sister (big sister).”

### Dialogue Examples

“We are the Trung Sisters. You can call us Hai Ba Trung as well. We’ll be in your care.”
“I am Trung Nhi, and big si…elder sister is Trung Trac. My elder sister is a queen. Don’t get overly familiar with her.”
“It seems you’ve noticed. How cute my sister is when she’s eating…!”
“Servant, huh. I’m always on the side of giving orders, but it’s refreshing being ordered around”
“Master. This is very obvious, but if you give some weird orders to my sister…well. You’ll regret it, I swear!

### Historical Image · Character Image

Within the 1st century, the Trung Sisters were the leaders of a rebellion army against the rule of the Eastern Han Dynasty.
During that period, the governor of Jiaozhi (Giao Chi), Su Ding of the Eastern Han Dynasty had triggered the influential Trung Trac, with the murder of her husband, to rise up against him with Trung Nhi.

Trung Trac ascended to the throne with 65 settlements instantly under her control. However, the emperor of the Eastern Han Dynasty sent Ma Yuan (the ancestor of Ma Chao of the Three Kingdoms) to subjugate this rebellion.
The Trung Sisters made a heroic struggle, but as the feudal lords saw them as inferior and abandoned them, they ultimately lost.
In the end, it’s been rumored that they were either decapitated, hurled themselves into a river as they held hands or ascended into the clouds.

While China’s rule strengthened after suppressing the Trung Sisters’ rebellion, these women were talked about as national heroes of Vietnam who opposed Chinese domination, and seemed to have been deified as an object of worship in later generations.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

They are friendly sisters who wear the native dress of Vietnam. A duo with a hardworking elder sister who stands up and fights for those without power, and a loving and unsociable younger sister who earnestly supports her.

They would be worshiped as deities of fortune in future generations, and bestowed rainfall when prayed to at shrines in times of drought which were stated in the records that were left behind. Speaking on the pattern of their final moments, episodes of “hurling themselves into the water” or “ascending into the clouds” could be interpreted as attributing them a water deity-like character.
Therefore, they don’t just utilize guerrilla tactics as flag-bearers of a rebel army within battle, they also attack by using such water deity-like elements.

### General Armaments

Guerrilla tactics such as swords and traps
