It has been stated that the moment the Trung Sisters stood up against the governor’s tyranny, the people rose up in concord and they gained control of 65 settlements from North Vietnam to the Guangdong Province with tremendous drive.
This Noble Phantasm is their unbreakable vigorous march and expansion of influence given form.
In this game, this is the manifestation of their charged vigor and combination of their swordsmanship.
Additionally, the baby elephants that they bring along provide support with their unison attack, but they themselves don’t even know what these elephants are.
