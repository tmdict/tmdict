### Personality

Compared to the original Bunyan she has more confidence and a “I’ll take care of it attitude”

However in reality she has less confidence than the original Bunyan. Her average human size is one of the reasons for her inferiority complex. On the other hand her need for approval is stronger than most people so she is torn between “It’s only natural that everyone hates me” and “Please love me more! Appreciate me!”

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

As a boss herself she thinks she should provide proper guidance to Master on the other hand she can’t help but worry about if Master will continue to support her. As their bond grows, she begins to respect Master as the ideal boss and sees them as an objective to aspire to.

### Dialogue Examples

“Enchanté! Servant, Alter Ego, Paul Bunyan. At last, my long awaited arrival. At …… last, at last, I’ve appeared as an Extra Class. This is great! Leave the rest to me! …… Huh? My body feels…… small……? Why? Why am I a girl? This is messed up!?”
“Everybody do your best!”
“Master, you are my employer, you have to properly focus on me!”

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Paul Bunyan in his prime was a lumberjack master and pioneer leader…. but for some reason he is a teenager of average human size and why is he a girl?

She is an independent being, tormented by regret and guilt over the “great feat” of pioneering the entire North American Continent and eradicating the frontier. Her sense of responsibility to fulfill her duties as a leader, her desire to escape from that responsibility, and her desire to have others accept what she has accomplished are all mixed together, resulting in her being an “impressionable teenager.”

Still, she accepts the role of Paul Bunyan and tries her best to demonstrate leadership. But she doesn’t want to endure any more pain if possible… In the midst of all this, she continues to search for herself. Till this day she is still soul searching. Looking for her ideal self she writes down the settings for her special moves in her notebook looking like a second-year middle school student.

She is always on the lookout for “delightful companions” who will like and work for her and to that end has become a video streaming idol. She thought that it would be easier than serious manual labor but it was a job that required more attention to detail than she ever imagined causing her even more stress. In order to gain support she is careful to conduct herself in a cordial manner as a lovely character.

Paul Bunyan, the pioneer leader who achieved the “great feat” has a tendency to pursue usefulness and rationality a bit too much (like the original Bunyan she believes that she has to be useful to be allowed to exist and has come to demand the same of the people around her). While she wants to get along with her colleagues and to be loved by everyone she thinks about her relationships with others in a calculating way which results in her words and actions seeming thoughtless.

On the other hand unlike the original Bunyan she isn’t solely focused on pioneering but believes that harmony with nature is necessary for the happiness of all humanity (this is thought to be due to syncretism and the influence of the Native American Heroic Spirits assimilated into her Spirit Origin as her words contains knowledge derived from the Native Americans that Bunyan would not have known about). She doesn’t want to think about the contraction in her pioneer nature.

Underneath the hat she always wears are rabbit-like ears. If she goes a while without wearing her hat, antlers like that of a deer will start to grow on both sides of her temples. She doesn’t know why this happens, and she doesn’t want people to talk about it so she rarely takes of her hat. For some reason she doesn’t like to expose her hands and feet so she’s always wearing gloves.

When she reaches her third ascension, she becomes the President of her dreams but in exchange her Spirit Origin will return to that of a child so, her power remains the same. However, due to the pressure of her duties her stress has increased.

### Syncretized Heroic Spirits

To strengthen her weak Spirit Origin she has fused with many Heroic Spirits. For some reason a lot of them gave their essence. It is unclear how thr delightful members of this zero unity group were chosen. Mayhaps their fates were tied in another world. In any case most of their true names will never be revealed. It’s possible they’re being kept secret by the Great Will, the World Order, that watches over us from outside .this world.

### General Armaments

In the first ascensions, the weapon resembles a tomahawk, and in the second ascension, a lacrosse stick (thrown at pine cones). Both were tools used by Native Americans but Super Bunyan does not know why they are used as regular weapons. In her third ascension, Super Bunyan will be modernized and will use a mysterious laser chainsaw, and be joined in battle by her merry band of friends. The motorized Babe, a.k.a. Autobabe, may look like a mecha, but it still retains its awareness as Babe.

### Connections with Characters

#### Paul Bunyan

She’s so innocent, it’s hard to watch. I don’t think she has to try that hard and I don’t want her to have a troubled childhood like I did.

#### Calamity Jane

Proper Human History Jane was a friend of hers and apparently didn’t dress in such revealing clothes.

#### Fumma Ninja Group

Evil Wind is such a cool name….

#### Mike Fink

A legendary shipwright who was active at the same time as Bunyan. He is infamous for his many tales of unprincipled bravery. He is now a mute crocodile (not exactly a crocodile, but apparently a misipeshu, a monster of folklore), perhaps due to his bad behavior during his lifetime. It is unknown if he still has any self awareness as Mike. Banyan hated Mike when he was alive, but now calls him Mikey and loves him as a pet.

#### ■■■■

A hero/trickster mentioned in the mythology of the indigenous peoples of northern North America, mainly the Ojibwe. Super Bunyan’s knowledge of the indigenous people and her special appearance are derived from this heroic spirit. In order to fulfill his own wish he snuck into Bunyan’s Spirit Origin and uses it to manifest. ■■■■ eroded and completely devoured Bunyan’s soul faster than they could be incorporated as part of Bunyan. A shape shifter ■■■■ mimicked Super Bunyan’s soul in order to keep his existence a secret. The result is a perfect copy of Super Bunyan’s personality unaware that’s it’s a fake and that it’s real self has long since been devoured by ■■■■. They had planned to masquerade as Super Bunyan for a while and then reveal themselves when the time was right, however the personality of Super Bunyan which they had copied had a strong teenage ego and stronger self interest than expected and so their self awareness was sealed deep inside her psyche. ■■■■’s self awareness has been completed sealed and the only knowledge of their existence is in a disoriented state within Super Bunyan. When Super Bunyan who is still soul searching one day comes to terms with herself, the world and finally finds peace of mind the sealed personality of ■■■■ will resurface, break the mimicry and take over the Spirit Origin. And then Super Bunyan’s personality will disappear without a trace.
