I aimed for a pub-like Mother Earth feeling. She’s everyone’s mom, who eats everything and gives birth to everything again\~ I’m going to eat you up\~♡ Everyone, let’s curl up like a cat and loaf on top of her while dreaming of ancient nature\~ She’s like a pub, after all\~♡ That’s the kind of image I had in mind. It’s a gentle world. A perfect Happy End☆ (WADARCO)
