### Personality

While she’s mostly the same person she is as an Assassin, she does seem more confident in her position as empress now that she looks more grown-up. She was always good at torturing people, but now she’s developed a bit of a thing for killing undead.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Basically the same as her Caster self.

She takes the stance that she has to show Master that she isn’t scared of ghosts. Instead she wants to use the ghosts at her command to scared them.

Summer has arrived.

“Since the others are no doubt waiting for me, perhaps it is time I graced them with my beautiful swimsuited presence!”

And so Wu Zetian gained a swimsuit Spirit Origin (specifically, a Caster) in a physically older body.

“You know, I had forgotten that I once mastered Taoist arts. I wonder how that happened? Oh well. Now that I have remembered them, I have nothing to fear from ghosts OR spirits! I am invincible!”

Just like that, she took advantage of her Servant nature to acquire Imperial Taoist Arts (which is to say, regular Taoist arts that have been customized to dispose of any sort of dead thing or spirit, an idea she lifted almost entirely from a movie which featured creatures like jiāngshī) by way of Imperial Privilege. With them, she now commands her Torturers, essentially her familiars, as if they were jiāngshī.

Having overcome her one weakness has left her in a great mood pretty much all the time. Perhaps because she now has a means of handling the undead, she’s developed a tendency to put all who work for her through the ringer. It’s almost like she’s doing so to relieve the frustration she felt from before…

Wu Zetian’s newly rediscovered capacity for Taoist arts gives rise to an inherent contradiction: Why was she afraid of spirits all this time? The truth is, when she was alive, her Taoist arts didn’t work; they had no effect at all. No matter how many times she chanted, the ghosts of those she had poisoned still plagued her, and cats still looked down at her with spite in their eyes. Small wonder, then, that she could not make use of Taoist arts when she had seen for herself how poorly they worked. This trauma tremendously complicated the prospect of her becoming a Caster, which was necessary to stabilize her swimsuit Spirit Origin. Scáthach-Skadi’s solution to this problem was to employ her runes to seal away Wu Zetian’s memories of her failures with Taoist arts.

Now that she is able to trust her own abilities, the newly swimsuited Wu Zetian appears (emphasis on appears) to have forgotten all about her fear of the undead. This, however, is owed entirely to her being able to deal with spirits meaning there is no reason for her to fear them. Once summer ends and she once more recalls how completely ineffective her arts were, or, alternatively, if she ever begins to worry about the possibility of encountering a righteous ghost she is unable to exorcise even in her new Spirit Origin, her experiences from this summer will vanish as though waking from a dream.

That’s right. Deep down, in her heart of hearts, she still feels as though she can never escape the spirits cursing her for all the political assassinations she enacted, whether or not she did so for the greater good of China. However, that is not weakness. This feeling stems from her pride in protecting her country, and in spite of her fears, she would do it all again if she had to.

And so, naturally, hard worker that she is, Wu Zetian continues to try to overcome her fear of spirits (and cats) even after summer draws to a close…

### Connections with Characters

#### Swimsuit Scáthach-Skadi

You want me to help with the special theme park? You can leave it to me.

#### Yang Guifei

Stop, stop it. Don’t stand close to me. Our presences are too similar, and that might divide people’s attention. Well, I am the better one.

#### Swimsuit Medb and Swimsuit Yu Mei-ren

When someone already beautiful puts on a swimsuit they attract even more eyes, it’s quite troubling… I’m sure you two understand, yes? Being too beautiful is a sin hehehe!

#### Swimsuit Carmila

A friend in torture. Discussing summer torture methods unique to their swimsuit Spirit Origins.

#### Shuten-Douji

Seeing the Jiāngshī-style Shuten at Chaldea also gave her a hint for her current look. Shuten finds it amusing and sometimes joins in with the Torturer Jiāngshī in that form. Shuten isn’t an undead so she isn’t affected by Wu Zetian’s spells. It’s pretty obvious she’s pretending to be under Wu’s control and using that as an excuse to cause trouble.
