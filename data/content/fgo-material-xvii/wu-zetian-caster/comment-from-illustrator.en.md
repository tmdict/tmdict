Since this is the late teens version of Fuuyaa-chan(Nite Brite/Nightless) — Fuuyaa-san(Shyne Brite/Shining????) — naturally I gave her a mature body. Her hairstyle alternates between a side ponytail and short hair for variety, and for the Third Ascension I designed it to evoke her original look. For her weapon, I chose something fitting for a Taoist: a flexible sword that combines the peach sword and the coin sword. It’s fun how all kinds of little things pop out during her attacks in the game, isn’t it? (Takehito Harada)
