### Consort’s Charisma (Summer): EX

Wu Zetian’s ability to sway hearts and minds, which she put to expert use as the consort for the Tang Dynasty’s Emperor Taizong. This charm is based on her beauty, intelligence, and skill in the performing arts It was so strong, it even kept the emperor’s son, Gaozong, under her spell. Though ill omens and prophecy warned of threats to her position, she managed to use her connections with China’s key figures, which she had made and maintained thanks once again to this skill, to successfully retain her position. While elements of this ability are present in the Charisma she possesses as an Assassin, they are far more effective now that she has gained a summer-ready swimsuit Spirit Origin and a body closer to the age she was back then to go with it.

“It just goes to show that no one can resist these perfect proportions!”

### Cursed Princess Wu: A

When Wu Zetian was younger, there was a prophecy that said, “A woman by the name of ’Wu’ will destroy the Tang Dynasty and gain control of China.” This prophecy is believed to have led to Emperor Taizong growing suspicious of Wu Zetian, known at the time as Wu Zhao, which led him to attempt to distance himself from her.

While this skill may seem similar to Yang Guifei’s Ruinous Beauty, it is actually very different. Instead of just ruining a nation, this skill denotes a person destined to remake what once was after the fact.

Perhaps due in part to her third skill, there are some differences in this skill’s effects while she is in this Spirit Origin.

### Emperor Taoism: EX

After the death of Emperor Taizong, Wu Zetian is said to have briefly entered a Taoist temple. Normally, she would have become a monk and never returned to the secular world, but at the request of Emperor Gaozong, the next emperor and son of Emperor Taizong, Wu Zetian returned to the palace. She was a hard worker and completely overflowing with talent and so in that short time seemed to master and understand almost everything about Taosim… (or so she says)

As a result, she obtained a Caster Spirit Origin and is able to use her Imperial Privilege to flawlessly utilize her own self taught adaptation of Taoist Arts, which for various reasons is specialized in fighting ghosts

Also as a result of acquiring more knowledge from the database, she ended up creating a method that involves her Torturers acting as if they were jiāngshī

In other words, this is a skill that demonstrates the technique and combat ability of a “professional in fighting the dead; a Taoist priest who controls Jiangshi.”
