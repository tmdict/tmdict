Come Forth, My Torturer Jiāngshī
A Taoist art in which Wu Zetian summons a small army of Torturers who have been transformed into jiāngshī thanks to the talismans placed on their foreheads. Forgetting their original purpose of being the best damn tormenters an empress could ask for, these Torturers hop around in a decidedly jiāngshī-esque fashion while following Wu Zetian’s orders, even as they find themselves wondering, “Why am I doing this again…?” Silently, of course. Oh, and for the record, they absolutely can walk around normally if they want.

Incidentally, anyone who wants to serve Wu Zetian can become an easily manipulatable jiāngshī just by having her place a talisman on their forehead and casting a spell, so new recruits are always welcome.

Attention, all you motivated, talented prospective jiāngshī! Come for the beautiful boss, stay for the fulfilling work, and as a bonus, enjoy a few rounds of refreshing torture when you foul up!
