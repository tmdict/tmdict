Ibuki-no-Mitama, Hachimyakudotou.
A Noble Phantasm Ibuki-Douji acquired upon declaring herself the goddess of summer. This fierce eight-hit combo water attack can lay waste to anything in its path. Indeed, there is no sight which could better reflect Ibuki-Douji’s wild godly nature than seeing eight jets of seawater furiously bearing down on you like the eight heads of Orochi.

While Ibuki-Douji does sometimes perform similar bare-handed attacks in her standard Saber Spirit Origin, they aren’t water attacks, and they’re certainly not Noble Phantasms. This Noble Phantasm, on the other hand, is only at her disposal while she is in her swimsuit Spirit Origin.
