### Midsummer Goddess: B

Who decides what is and isn’t summery? Swimsuit Spirit Origin Ibuki-Douji. That’s who. Why is that, you ask? Because now that she’s in a swimsuit Spirit Origin, she has decided she is the goddess of summer. And since she’s also a wild Divided Spirit, she can be pretty terrifying when she wants.

### Summer Cheerleader: C

In her swimsuit, Ibuki-Douji is both the goddess of summer and a cheerleader. As such, she will happily cheer on anyone and everyone who wants to enjoy summer. If you’re lucky, you may even get to see her doing so in her cheerleader outfit. Incidentally, Ibuki-Douji insists that she modeled her outfit after that of a typical high school cheerleader. According to a certain member of Chaldea’s staff, however, very few high school cheerleaders are quite as…glamorous as this one.

### Beach Apocalypse: A+

When Ibuki-Douji decides to enjoy the beach in summer, be prepared for her to pretty much bring the world down around her. Now that she’s changed into her summer outfit, her sheer destructive power is along the lines of something you’d expect to see on Judgment Day.

Everyone, run! That lady’s hot as hell, but she’s really, REALLY drunk!
