### Personality

Essentially the same as her Saber form. A kind, cheerful, easygoing Heroic/Divine Spirit lady who’s totally adapted to modern life…and who occasionally acts like a terrifying ancient god.

### Attitude towards Master

“I want to enjoy summer.”

“I want to give summer enjoyment”

She celebrates all who think this way.

If Master has even the smallest desire to “enjoy summer” there is no way she’d miss it.

That being said I beseech you be careful.

Even if she appears to be a bright and cheerful beach girl or a cheerleader, she is still a god. Her words like nature itself can manifest in various ways. If one were to utter even one simple phrase like “I wish summer would never end,” something terrifying could very well descend upon the land.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

It is summer. And summer means swimsuit Spirit Origins. After experiencing summer in the Caribbean and realizing how nice it is, Ibuki-Douji thought it was time for her to change into a swimsuit Spirit Origin of her own. And that’s exactly what she did! She took one look at her own Spirit Origin and changed it herself.

After deciding that her new swimsuit Spirit Origin qualifies her as a goddess of summer, Ibuki-Douji has been delighting in the various forms summer has taken around her.

“Yup feels like summer.” “Feel like summer.” “Everyone looks so summery! Everyone looks so great!”

She said as she made fairly lenient judgments on what was summer.

Whatever else happens, protect summer vacation.

But this is all a pretence… In truth she has a scary side.

Ibuki-Douji first appeared as a customer in the summer Arctic Circle Singularity’s third area, followed by another appearance in the fifth as the Servant in charge. However…she also turned out to be the true mastermind behind the entire Singularity, as she was the one who told Douman to give Skadi the Holy Grail.

“If the world disappears, we can just make a new one.”

That was Ibuki-Douji’s thinking upon first acquiring a Holy Grail. It was for that purpose that she decided to declare herself a god—the god of an eternal summer park. Sunlight and flame would bring summer warmth to the Arctic Circle, while water and waves would bring refreshment.

…If this world is to disappear amid a sea of endless white, then I shall be the one to begin it anew.

Swimsuit Ibuki-Douji gained the power to rule over summer by binding herself to a Holy Grail, thereby making herself the sun that illuminates the Singularity. This sun is conceptual, and seems to fluctuate in size. Most everywhere in the Singularity, it looks like an ordinary sun, though it is perhaps unusually large. But if you stand near Arctic Summer World’s biggest landmark, the icy Arctic Tower that contains Ibuki-Douji’s throne, it appears to be an enormous ball of light floating directly overhead. Incidentally, when viewed from the observatory on the tower’s top floor with its open ceiling, the sun doesn’t appear all that big.

As long as this sun shines bright in the sky, it will bestow great power upon Ibuki-Douji, even if it doesn’t quite reach the level of true Authority. Though of course, if her connection to the Holy Grail is broken, this sun, and its power, will eventually disappear. (Note: The swimsuit Spirit Origin Ibuki-Douji registered at Chaldea possesses neither this sun, nor a connection to a Holy Grail)

Incidentally, a certain good wife-type Servant has gone on the record as saying, “A sun god? Don’t you think that’s encroaching on my territory? Why don’t you stick to your Yamata-no-Orochi lane, and I’ll stick to mine?”

### Connections with Characters

#### Summer Scathach-Skadi
A goddess of summer along with me. I want her to enjoy summer to the fullest.

#### Swimsuit Gareth

Target of congratulations. A bright smile and a lively girl. She’s just like the sun

#### Valkyries

Targets of congratulations. Swans who care about their strange mother. But when I see those swans flying in the sky I feel lonely. (This is because they remind her of Yamato Takeru, a swan that vanished into the sky after his death.)

#### Ashiya Douman

Limbo-kun. An appetizer that goes with alcohol.

#### Yan Qing / Asclepius

Targets of congratulations. Although they acted as trusted guardians for the summer group, they were still worrying about if everyone properly had fun this summer.

#### Lady Avalon

Target of congratulations. It’s a secret. Secret.

#### Swimsuit Erice

Target of congratulations. Cute. From Ibuki-Douji’s perspective she looks to be a child. Also has a nostalgic smell for some reason?

#### Swimsuit Wu Zetian

Target of congratulations. China….It feels nostalgic, but it also doesn’t…

Swimsuit Jeanne D’Arc/Swimsuit Jeanne Alter
Target of congratulations. These swimsuit Spirit Origin girls, their entire existence is now summer. Awesome.
