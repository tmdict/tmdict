There’s lots of fun to be had with each swimsuit Ascension so I designed it as the basic first Ascension, playful second Ascension, and superior third Ascension. My favorite is the nodate umbrella from the first Ascension, as Ibuki-Douji is the only one who can use that as a parasol, and I chose the visor and competitive swimsuit for a sporty look.

The American cheerleading costume from the second Ascension is entirely my own preference, and for the third Ascension, I wondered how I could create a dignified look with a Japanese-style swimsuit-like outfit, and that’s how I came up with that design.

I also like the Noble Phantasm, where she’s on all fours, aiming for her prey. (Raita Honjo)
