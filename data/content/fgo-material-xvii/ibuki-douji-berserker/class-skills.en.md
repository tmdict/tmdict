### Dragonkin: EX

A skill that shows that one is a dragon, a powerful phantasmal species. As she is the Divided Spirit of the dragon of calamity Yamata-no-Orochi, she has this skill at a non-standard rank.

### Core of the Serpent God: A

A composite skill that includes Divinity. As the child of Yamata-no-Orochi, she has this skill at an exceptionally high rank. If she were to degrade into an oni, she would lose this skill and have it replaced with low ranked Divinity skill.

### Madness Enhancement: E

Ibuki-Douji chose to be a Berserker for her swimsuit Spirit Origin. Maybe because she modeled it off of Sakata Kintoki who happened to be nearby, her Madness Enhancement skill is ranked as low as possible.
