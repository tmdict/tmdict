Looking at it, there are lots of different facial expressions, which is fun…! The Third Ascension is the same as in Fate/Requiem. The First Ascension is more modern, and it’s a style that’s easy to move in, like Erice likes. For the Second Ascension, one of the rejected ideas for the uniform design in Fate/Requiem was a sailor suit with a marine feel, so I made it in a swimsuit style. It’s cute, age appropriate and one of my favorites. (NOCO)
