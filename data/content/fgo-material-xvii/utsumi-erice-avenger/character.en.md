### Personality

Basically the same as her Lancer self.

She values efficiency in everything she does, and prefers highly functional, practical, and simple things. This also applies to her meals, where she mostly goes for easy-to-prepare, nutritious foods, but within her free time she has an unusual preference for extremely spicy food.

Due to her past, she has strong doubts about mages and their organizations, and draws a line between them and her by thinking of herself as a “magecraft user”. In Mosaic City, she was tasked with the grueling job of exterminating illegal Servants, and out of necessity, she began to learn a lot about Heroic Spirits, but ironically, this eventually led her to develop a deep respect for them. Although Erice was very confused and resistant after being summoned, she soon began to feel relieved as she came to understand how Servants are treated in Chaldea and how they interact with the protagonist.

### Attitude towards Master

Basically the same as her Lancer self.

However, perhaps because she relaxes while in her Swimsuit Spirit Origin (especially the First and Second Ascensions), she, though not without feeling embarrassed, honestly express her trust in the protagonist. She openly confesses that she wants to have a relationship where she can rely on them and they can rely on her. Having come to understand Chaldea, Erice herself hopes to have an ideal Servant Master relationship.

In her Third Ascension, perhaps due to receiving all sorts of backlash and self-discipline, she has become much more vigilant and disciplined and is just as on edge as she was during her time as a Nightwatch. She seems to have become world wise enough to be able to skillfully switch between everyday mode and work mode.

### Character Image According to the Original Work

Japan, in the near future following the end of a Holy Grail War. A young girl who works as a Nightwatch in Mosaic City (Akihabara). The savagery of her methods of hunting down Servants has earned her the nickname Grim Reaper. In a history different from that of Chaldea she participated in a Holy Grail War with Voyager, the final Servant summoned to the world. However, she has no idea as to that battle’s actual outcome.

Since childhood, she has been possessed by an evil spirit, which appears as a black, sludge-like substance that seeps from the surface of her body. This spirit, which she calls “Erlkönig,” can change its shape and density at will and consume Servants down to their Spirit Cores, making it an excellent anti-Servant weapon.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

She holds Heroic Spirits in great reverence, and treats their Servant incarnations with the same respect and courtesy. However, she is deeply suspicious of modern-day mages.

With Akihabara transformed into a coastal resort city, swimsuits were considered typical casual wear. According to her swimsuits are just outfits that doesn’t slow you down if they gets wet and any other thing such as feeling exited or showing off to others is just a hobby.

The mesh-like part of her bangs is actually a Mystic Code, that she used frequently as a Nightwatch and has been incorporated into her Spirit Origin. It works like a high performance smartphone or AI device and has functions such as communication, scanning the environment and translation.

Erice’s circumstances are unique in that she was born in a state between Servant and human. As a result, she has manifested as something of a quasi-Servant state, possessing very human traits despite technically being a Servant.

### Connections with Characters

#### Voyager

Ah, Voyager… I can’t believe you’ve grown up this much! This is troubling. I really can’t handle it. This may be the the greatest crisis I’ve faced since coming to Chaldea. Eh? You were worried about me? You think I’m a no-good older sister? Hmph how sausy. Well, I just have to keep working hard right?

#### Caren C Hortensia (Amor)

I just can’t help calling Caren “Sensei” but she doesn’t scold me for it. Rather, while wearing a faint smile, what she says is: “Your vocabulary is too unbalanced. You should have poison arrows other than porca.{{n1}} You’re like a god of poverty who can’t afford the words to say rather than a Grim Reaper” Ah~ Sensei really is the best.

#### Sir Kay

I’ve heard rumors about this swimsuit from members of the Round Table. Depending on who’s telling it, the impression I get changes. Seriously what in the hell kind of person is Sir Kay? The mystery deepens…

#### Sasaki Kojiro

I tried to meet that samurai, while calling out “Tsuda-san” but somehow he managed to dodge me. According to him, “Well, this body is the Servant Sasaki Kojiro, who has vague relationships and history and that should be enough. At least Infront of our Master”

But there is something I wanted to ask him….

#### Napoleon

Chaldea’s Napoleon is an Archer. He’s a different Servant from the Bonaparte I know. That one’s a Rider and is much slimmer. It’s confusing, but maybe that’s what makes Servants interesting.

#### Ptolemy

The first king of Alexandria…! One of the successors who built the great library that shines brightly in ancient history! He must also be the one to whom Euclid answered, “There is no easy road to geometry.” Ah~ he’s so awe-inspiring. It’s something impossible for me to answer, but the best I can say is “The painful road has no end. Like a pilgrimage route, the end is a new starting point”… or something like that?

It’s not like I’ll ever get the chance….

1. {{note1}} “Porca” roughly means (female) pig/swine, but it’s normally used for swearing or to insult others.
