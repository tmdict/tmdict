The ship Sukunabikona-no-Kami used to plow through the raging eternal seas to arrive in the mortal world. It is made out of dried potato husks and is also known as the Utsurobune. When Erice first gained her swimsuit Spirit Origin, she rented this boat, capable of traveling between worlds, including this one and Tokoyo-no-Kuni, under a certain condition.

That condition being that if a minor god who Sukunabikona-no-Kami considered a close friend, a Kunitsukami{{n1}}, were to manifest in the present day and found themselves in trouble then Erice would row the boat out and attempt a rescue even at risk of her own life.
