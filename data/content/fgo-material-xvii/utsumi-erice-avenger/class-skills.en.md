### Avenger: C

This skill is a manifestation of the way she strongly attracts hatred and resentment. Any negative emotions directed at them by those around them instantly become a source of strength for an Avenger.

### Oblivion Correction: C

Avengers never forget. The evil spirit that lives deep in Erice’s body tirelessly seethes in hatred for Heroic Spirits.

### Self Restoration (Magical Energy): EX

Magical energy will continue to surge until the evil spirit has completed it’s revenge, but that time will never come. Erice subconsciously continues to resist, trying to suppress the impulse to rampage.

### Riding: C+

Talent for riding. Able to control small ships from ancient times to the modern day, as well as other modern vehicles, with average skill. Particularly suited to vehicles that match the summer seaside.

### Independent Action: B

A special characteristic of Quasi-Servants. Only in combat does she consume magical energy and apart from that she’s able to function the same as a normal human with no magical energy cost.

### Divinity: E

Weak divinity coming from the underworld goddess Izanami. It also affects the Riding Skill.
