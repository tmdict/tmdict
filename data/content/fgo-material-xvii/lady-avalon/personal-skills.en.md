### Light Be in Your Hands: B

A blessing given to those who struggle with something so powerful they can scarcely imagine it. This blessing, however, is meant to help them on their quest to claim what they desire, rather than simply giving it to them outright. (In fact, this is actually a variant of Hero Creation.)

### Flower Blooming on a Summerâ€™s Night: D

Charisma which people of all types naturally gravitate towards. This tends to draw people towards her until she finds herself the center of attention. However, as she loves fun and novel things, and tends to wander around freely on her own rather than put down roots in any one place, she is rarely able to make full use of this skill. (In fact, this is actually a variant of Dreamlike Charisma.)

### Succubus Ridge: A+

Her power as the last Succubus on Earth. Her true nature. A combination of Illusion and Mystic Eyes. With a gaze of the battlefield, enemies and allies included, she can step into the minds of enemies and drain their magical energy.
