### Territory Creation: D

Allows for the creation of a workshop to create a favorable position for one’s self as a mage. Perhaps because she is a complete nomad and has a free-spirited approach to her activities, never settling in one place, she doesn’t have much experience setting up territories.

### Rapid Casting (Monster): EX

Has the ability to speed up magical casting. Though not divine words, the beauty of her spells is already on the level of fairy words. Her spells are fast, short, and have a somewhat sad tone.

### Item Construction: A+

Can create magical tools. The staff she holds in her hand is her workshop, so she can make various tools in an instant.

### Mixed Blood: EX

She has some non-human blood mixed in her. As she is Merlin’s sister, it’s only natural that she be born from an Incubus and that she completely inherited all the traits of an Succubus…. at least that’s what she says

### Independent Manifestation: A

A Skill that permits unsupported manifestation into reality. She acquired this skill on her own and uses it for her hobby. This is one of the reasons she appeared here, somewhere she has no natural connection to.
