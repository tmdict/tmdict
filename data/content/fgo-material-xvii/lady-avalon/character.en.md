### Personality

A pretty flower of a woman who never loses her composure. Her beauty often makes those who meet her feel as though they’re in a dream, and leaves some men with the impression that she may even be an enchantress sent to entice them to their doom.

She views the world objectively, as though she’s always aware of the bigger picture, a step removed from normal perspectives. Some people interpret this dryness as serene wisdom, while others see it as typical for a coldhearted mage.

As a Mage of Flowers, she understands that the human world is a cruel and ugly place, but also has a soft spot for it, believing that it’s basically okay “as long as they have a single star that still shines bright.”

### Attitude towards Master

She treats them kindly with a smile, but she continues to maintain the distance between them. This is because she is aware that Master is human, while she is an outsider.

However if the time comes where she feels like Master is a “shining star” she’ll take a step forward and truly deepen their bond.

### Character Image

When did she get here…? A pretty, flowery mage who’s there, smiling a gentle smile before you even notice her.

“As you can see I’m a lovely big sister watching over your journey with a smile”

She reminds me of someone. She reeeally reminds me of someone. It may have been Master who said that, or Technical Advisor Da Vinci, or Director Goredolf. Maybe she’s related to you-know-who somehow? Yeah, you know. The Mage of Flowers, Mer—

“That’s right! Of course I remind you of Merlin. I’m his little sister, after all.”

Oh, okay! That makes sense!

She will never reveal her true identity.

Why does she desperately flee the King Arthur who claims to be from another world? Even if what she says about having come here from paradise is true, there’s no way she can actually be Merlin’s sister. Even if you ask her directly, she’ll only smile gently in response.

Maybe…it’s not actually possible for her to answer this question herself? Maybe if she did, she’d dissolve into foam and disappear?

…Who am I? …What’s my True Name?

The most likely reason she was made a Pretender is that she won’t answer those questions, no matter what. At any rate, as has been stated, she refuses to give her name. Instead, she simply stands there smiling like a flower, watching over the Master of Chaldea’s journey.

Furthermore, it’s still not clear how she ended up in the summer Arctic Circle Singularity. Sometimes, she says that the Holy Grail called her there. Other times, she says that she came of her own accord. If she really is connected to Merlin somehow, it’s entirely possible that she came simply because she wanted to. 

Though of course, we’ll never get the truth out of her either way…

### Connections with Characters

#### Arthur Pendragon

You don’t know me! Now get!

#### Merlin

Yes, I’m telling the truth. That guy is my big brother. Non-interference? What are you talking about?

#### Valkyries

Hehe, they were quite reckless! I hope they enjoy Chaldea to the fullest.

#### Knights of the Round Table

You could say it’s a familiar line up but you could also say they’re completely different. Truly interesting.

#### The Various Atoria Pendragons

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t interested. But I understand. Her journey isn’t mine to watch over.

#### Draco

If nothing else, I really am glad to see you’re doing well.
