Utopia That Beckons Beyond.
Avalon will continue to exist for as long as humankind does, and Lady Avalon sees it as the ideal future humankind hopes to reach one day. That is why the Avalon in which she lives is not shut away from the outside world, but instead positioned as a goal she has set for humanity to strive towards.

The staff she wields points to a place just over the horizon. It is a guiding light, and the very hope that still drives people ever forward.

That is why she continues to point the way: so those who continue to advance will not falter, in hope that one day, their journey may finally come to an end.

Once this Noble Phantasm’s True Name is released, all nearby can see a far-off utopia that lies in a phantasmal world. They can feel a warm, pleasant spring breeze filled with the scent of flowers—a breeze that feels as though it can melt even the coldest of frozen, desolate seas. It fills those who dream of utopia with the sense that such a thing truly could become reality.
