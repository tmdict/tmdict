I drew this new Servant based on Proto Merlin who was Implemented in FGO Arcade. It’s been a while since I made Proto Merlin, so my sensibilities have changed a bit, so I tried my best not to ruin the impression of the Arcade version while designing this new version.

Her First Ascension was chiefly influenced by Arcade’s Second Ascension with bits and pieces coming from Arcade’s First and Third Ascensions.

For the Second Ascension, I struggled for a long time with whether to put the garter under the bottoms or on top, but in the end I prioritized the design and put it on top.

For the Third Ascension, we first considered the motion and then adjusted the appearance. We decided on a dress style but in the end it ended up becoming something quite abstract.

I tried my best to add elegance while also making it possible to sense the changes from the First Ascension. (Taiki)
