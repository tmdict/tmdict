As this is a “Valkyrie Swimsuit,” I aimed for a silhouette reminiscent of military uniform when making design. Regular Valkyries have a special design in which each Ascension results in a different personality, but this time, as they are welfare characters, Ortlinde, Hildr, and Thrúd have each been made into separate individuals, and you can obtain one of them, in a truly Valkyrie-like implementation. As with regular the Valkyries, I considered providing two other characters for each valkyrie, for a total of nine, but that was a bit too much, so I went with the current format. I have a lot of attachment to the three new characters, so I was especially moved to be able to implement them. (Takeuchi Takashi)
