### Personality

Well-versed in the art of battle, fiercely courageous, and has a keen sense of insight. 
Basically the same as they were as Lancers.
While it may seem that each unit has a different personality as a consequence of their superficial differences, at their heart, each sister is driven by the same behavioral principles—so much so that they could all be called the same unit.
Even the Valkyries themselves insist that there are no real differences between them……
Despite all that, at least when it comes to how they present themselves,

“I feel like Thrúd is the earnest, honour student type”

“I feel like Rindr is a natural airhead that does things her own way”

“I feel like Hildr is friendly and approachable”

“I feel like Rún is highly sensitive and avoids anything that might lead to conflict”

“I feel like Ortlinde is the reserved type”

“I feel like Irs is deeply earnest and an individualist”

the fact is that reports like this have been coming in from members of Chaldea’s staff.

Also the three new sisters, Rindr, Rún and Irs, are not yet used to the current world so they seem to be sensitive to the souls and presence of brave warriors. They all seem to have an instinctual interest in them (because, in a sense, they are their goal of action as Valkyries).

### Attitude towards Master

Thrúd basically reacts the same way she did as a Lancer. They have been reports of her showing more positive behavior but it’s currently not possible to confirm with her. (A Chaldea staff member who tried to directly confim this with Thrúd got scolded with Thrúd saying “Being more positive, there is no way that can happen?”).

Rindr on the other hand is interested in the relationship (distance) Thrúd and Master and is equally as interested in her own “error” (the differences between her and the other Valkyries).

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The Valkyries, daughters of the Allfather, have transformed into new stealth-optimized Spirit Origins, albeit ones that seem like they should be called “summer Spirit Origins” rather than “swimsuit Spirit Origins.”

Thanks to Lady Avalon the valkyries Thrúd, Hildr and Ortlinde were able to get special Spirit Origins. These special Spirit Origins allow the new valkyries who appeared at Chaldea, Rindr, Rún and Irs to tie their existence to Chaldea’s previous valkyries. By putting on and taking off the spiritron dress it’s possible to decide which of the sisters appears on the surface. When not in combat it’s also possible for the sisters to appear at the same time.

One more note on Rindr, Rún, and Irs, the Valkyries who newly materialized in the Arctic Circle Singularity. At first, it was thought that Scáthach-Skadi was the one who summoned them…but now, many suspect that the Allfather himself may have had a hand in their appearance.
