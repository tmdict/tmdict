### Primordial Rune (Midsummer): A

Scáthach-Skadi, who has changed into her summer Spirit Origin, continues to use the Primordial Runes. Apparently, the runes themselves have also undergone a summer makeover of sorts, but only she knows exactly what that makeover entails.

### Midsummer Frozen Treat: C

“I love frozen treats. They’re both cold and sweet.” At random moments Scáthach-Skadi shows a girlish smile.

Originally a composite skill including the effects of the Beach Crisis skill, it now has the effect of buffing her allies.

A certain Chaldea employee has said that for Heroic Spirits who know the warrior Scáthach, the one known as “Queen of the Land of Shadows” in Erin (Ireland) and who shares a face with Skadi, the buff becomes even stronger however we’ve been unable to confirm this in readings.

### Fanciful Summer Nights: A+

Having changed her own Spirit Origin, Scáthach-Skadi has become what you would call a pensive summer goddess. She thinks about how to best help Master—as well as every other Proper Human History survivor in Chaldea—and the various Servants enjoy what summer has to offer. She thinks about how her other self—the shadowy queen who lived through a Lostbelt— is doing.

And she’s definitely also thinking about how she can avoid making any more mistakes like she did at Christmas…
