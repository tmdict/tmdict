Door to the Great Sea Teeming with Life.
Scáthach-Skadi uses magical energy to form a gate in midair that unleashes a torrent of seawater brimming with fish, flooding the combat arena and enveloping its targets. While it works as an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm when used for offensive purposes, Skadi says it was meant to be an exhilarating park attraction designed to let visitors experience the beauty of the ocean.

It functions by using both the Primordial Runes and the giant sea god Ægir’s protection. Even as a Servant, Scáthach-Skadi remains under the protection of the vanished Scandinavian Lostbelt gods, whether she knows it or not.
