One thing is that I wanted a design that wasn’t too flashy, so that’s the First Ascension. The Second Ascension represents the consequences of letting loose and getting a bit too excited.

We tested the transparency of the sweater’s knit pattern on the battle sprite. There’s also a swimsuit costume without the sweater, so you get a double treat.

The Third Ascension feels both godlike and bridal. The icefish have simple runes embedded in them and are set to swim independently in the air. It brings a refreshing coolness. (Koyama Hirokazu)
