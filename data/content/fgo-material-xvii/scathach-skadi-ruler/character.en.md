### Personality

Basically the same as her Caster self. However since she has temporarily defined herself as the “Goddess of Summer”, she always thinking “What should I do for everyone?” in regards to the long awaited summer.

She doesn’t really think about herself and that’s because when her Spirit Origin changed her endurance stat went up causing her to get overconfident, thinking she can do a few reckless things.

### Attitude towards Master

Basically the same as her Caster self.

During the 2024 Summer Event, she thought she had to do something to get everyone excited. After spending a bit too much time in thought she ended up accepting Douman’s Arctic Holy Grail (which was given to him by Ibuki Douji).

### Dialogue Examples

Same as Caster form.

Summer is here. And this year’s summer minute Singularity is taking place somewhere no one would ever expect: the Arctic Circle!

“Enjoy the summer. Know that it has descended upon this land for all eternity.”

So spoke the Divine Spirit Scáthach-Skadi—who apparently acquired the Holy Grail that appeared in the Arctic Circle—to Master and the other Chaldea staff and Servants.

Now come on in! Arctic Summer World is open for business!

In this year’s summer event, Scáthach-Skadi obtained the Holy Grail that appeared in the Arctic Circle and used it to create a minute Singularity. However, she was not the one who originally found it. No, that was Ibuki-Douji in her Wild Divided Spirit mode. Furthermore, it was Ibuki-Douji who entrusted Ashiya Douman of all people with giving Scáthach-Skadi the Grail. However, according to various sources, Douman actually received the Grail from Ibuki-Douji during the Caribbean adventure, and had been waiting for the right moment to give it to Scáthach-Skadi ever since.

Scáthach-Skadi found herself shaken by Ibuki-Douji’s declaration.

“If the world is to disappear, then we need merely make it anew.”

As insane as Ibuki-Douji’s proposal was, Skadi couldn’t bring herself to refuse outright.

“Proper Human History may not be my world…but, I still could not bear to see another world disappear…”

And so, she made her wish, and the Holy Grail began to thrum with power…

During the summer event, Scáthach-Skadi came frighteningly close to disappearing thanks to a severe lack of magical energy. This is because she told Arctic Summer World’s managers, “Use as much magical energy as you wish. Enjoy yourself however you like. Have fun with all of your friends,” and placed no restrictions on their magical energy usage, opting to make up for any deficiencies with her own pool of energy…

Or at least, so we were led to believe. In actual fact, this occurred because Ashiya Douman was draining more magical energy from her than necessary for his own nefarious scheme.

When all was said and done, Queen Medb had some choice words for her, and all Skadi could do was offer her most profuse apologies. Also when Caster Cú Chulainn brought her some warm fruit liqueur… she cried for a bit and she smiled for a bit.

### General Armaments

A floating fish familiar.

The gate that acts as her Noble Phantasm normally functions as a spatial pocket that can take in and bring out the floating fish in an instant.

### Connections with Characters

#### Valkyrie Thrúd / Valkyrie Hildr / Valkyrie Ortlinde / The Three New Valkyrie Sisters

When I gave them their summer Spirit Origins, their numbers increased. While I am relieved that all seem that they seem to be doing well, I can’t help but worry that Odin might have intervined and tampered with their Spirit Origins.

#### Swimsuit Ibuki Douji / Ashiya Douman

Thank you for putting up with my selfishness.

#### Swimsuit Gareth / Yan Qing / Asclepius / Swimsuit Erice / Swimsuit Wu Zetian

They’re all lovely. I hope they enjoyed this summer even a little.

#### Medb

I’m sorry for making you worry……

#### Scáthach

After everything, she learned that Scáthach, too, did all sorts of things one summer and thought “I see”

#### Caster Cú Chulainn

(Angry pout)
