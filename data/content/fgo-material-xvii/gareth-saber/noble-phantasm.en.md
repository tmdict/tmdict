The Wolf Maiden’s True Draw.
A whirling cleave unleashed through her Noble Phantasm, the Red Sword, as the apex expression of her peerless conditioning and swordsmanship, which have been honed to perfection.
A masterfully delivered deathblow that, when funneled through her Mystic Sword and its overwhelming firepower, manifests as a destructive force.
To put it simply: it’s a strong blade executing a super technique… it’s just OP, really.

The Red Sword.
The sword formerly belonged to the Red Knight, Sir Ironside, whom Gareth bested during the siege to rescue Dame Lyonesse.
It is marked by intricate crimson filigree and innate ignition capacity.
The Red Knight is an archetypal figure associated with fire, rooted in the notion of ungovernable chaos, and is also said to bear some connection to the ancient Roman deity Robigus.
In this entry, its True Name is not typically released. It serves as Saber Gareth’s default armament and the conduit for her Noble Phantasm activation.
A continuously active-type Noble Phantasm.
