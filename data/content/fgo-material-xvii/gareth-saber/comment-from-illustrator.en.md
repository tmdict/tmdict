Initially, Aned wasn’t even supposed to be an NPC, so I had to blend him into the background art in a realistic fahsion. Gareth’s design was laid out so she wouldn’t block him from view. Balancing the outfit, the pup, and that oversized sword was a real juggling act and, while I technically wasn’t allowed to change her pose, I ended up sneaking in a slight adjustment between versions. I was asked to come up with a hefty medieval-style armor with a swimsuit theme, which launched me into a full-on art odyssey. I sketched out tons of Mobile Suit Girl-style drafts before finally getting the green light to shoot for something more offbeat. I remember carefully designing everything so the metal parts never made direct contact with her skin. (Nekotawawa)
