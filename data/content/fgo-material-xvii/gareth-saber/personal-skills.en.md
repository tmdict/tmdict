### Quick Change: EX

Gareth can swap outfits in a heartbeat!
A repurposed skill born from the transformed properties of her Noble Phantasm, the Ring of Metamorphosis, adapted alongside her Summer Saint Graph. Grants bonus perks like heightened combat response and lightning-fast draw as well.
The megaphone she totes in her First Ascension seems to be a special handoff from Osakabehime, commemorating her summer-class debut.

### Sunny Gareth: B+

At the height of midsummer, Gareth’s dazzling smile blazes with the brilliance of the noonday sun, rallying the spirit and vigor of whoever catches sight of it.
Still, there’s concern among the affected: without sufficient sunscreen, her lovely fair skin might suffer sunburn (never mind the fact that Servants can’t tan to begin with)…

### Red Sword: C

The Red Knight’s Mystic Sword, once wielded as the Noble Phantasm of Sir Ironside, whom Gareth once bested in battle, has since been reclassified as a skill.
