### Personality

Fundamentally, she remains unchanged from her time as a Lancer.
However, perhaps owing to the absence of her knightly robes, her ratio as an apprentice now leans more toward the adventurous side than the chivalric one. Clearly the type to chase thrills before remembering her vow to safeguard her liege.
According to some Chaldea’s staff, she gives off more the vibe of an overhyped sports club rookie tagging along on a field expedition than that of a proper knight on duty.
Even so, the skills that once earned her the moniker of “Ira Lupus” under King Arthur’s command remain as sharp as ever. Gareth’s not one to pick fights, but if push comes to shove, she’ll unsheathe her Mystic Sword and bring her Noble Phantasm down with full force.

### Attitude towards Master

Her demeanor toward her Master is noticeably milder than usual.
As a result, she gives off more of a junior or underclassman vibe.
She deliberately adopts this conduct because she believes that maintaining the usual knight-lord formalities would dampen the summer mood.

### Dialogue Examples

Summer Gareth’s taking the field!
Heads up!
Where are we off to today? Wherever it is, I’m tagging along!
I shan’t withhold my blade! Have at thee!
Hehe, who’s a good boy? You are, yes you are!

Same as Lancer form.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

To complete her transformation into what many call the strongest Class, Gareth needed just one key piece when switching into her Summer Saint Graph: a sword.
A red-hued Mystic Sword she was never able to wield under her previous Saint Graph.
Refreshing draw!
Witness Gareth’s swordplay, by the blade she draws exclusively this summer!

A fine blade in a finer hand.
In Gareth’s conception, the gold standard of sword-wielding knighthood is set by her elder brother Gawain and by Sir Lancelot. To her, they are benchmarks of greatness, lodestars, and beacons she look up to.
Her current Saint Graph owes much to this internalized ideal. The Third Ascension, in particular, embodies the archetype of the sword-bearing knight Gareth dreams of becoming, as inspired by her two personal heroes.
It was only some time after adopting this form that she became aware of this aspect of herself.

About the dog?
There is indeed a dog but she has no idea where it came from.
By Gareth’s own account, the dog appeared sometime after she adopted this Saint Graph and crossed paths with Merlin. However, it doesn’t seem to be an ordinary dog, as it assists her in battle. She’s taken to calling him “Aned” and spoils him quite a bit.
Whether this Aned is the very same hound who joined Cavall in King Arthur’s legendary boar hunting campaign, or merely a namesake chosen by Gareth, remains unknown.

### Connections with Characters

#### Lady Avalon

Though she earnestly claims to be Merlin’s younger sister, Gareth frequently takes her for Merlin himself. But how could that be, when they don’t even match in height or gender?

#### Summer Scáthach-Skadi

She’s so sparkly, like a fairytale princess!

#### Valkyrie Thrúd

She’s such a reliable older sister type, I lowkey want one of my own.

#### Valkyrie Hildr

She’s such a radiant older sister type, I lowkey want one of my own.

#### Valkyrie Ortlinde

I think we hit it off cuz we’re both the youngest in the family and dog lovers. We’re practically besties!

#### Summer Erice

We’re around the same age, so I always wanted to be friends with her… and mission accomplished!

#### Summer Ibuki Douji

I heard she’s got this super famous celebrated sword! Now I kinda wanna see it for myself!

#### Summer Wu Zetian

She’s always been so pint-sized, so seeing her Summer Saint Graph really threw me for a loop!

#### Asclepius

The shipboard doctor. I wonder if he got to enjoy the summer at all.

#### Yan Qing

I still can’t wrap my head around how someone can be that crazy strong bare-handed.

#### Ashiya Douman

??? I don’t really get him.

#### Lancelot

I really wanna show off my Saber Saint Graph to him!

#### Gawain & Percival

I have to get in a few rounds with them while I’ve got this Saint Graph!

### Others

A Summer Saint Graph in Chaldea is, in essence, stepping beyond the zone of one’s usual self and indulging in a stolen moment of freedom.
I believe I can assent to that notion.
It is the casting off of the constraints imposed by your immutable self inscribed into the annals of the Human Order.
What one elects to do with that sliver of autonomy hinges upon one’s own circumstances and compass.
Some may gravitate toward revelry; others toward love.
And I’m certain there are those who will seize the chance to chase long-forsaken dreams. (Skadi)
