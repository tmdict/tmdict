Fylgja Valkyrie.
A multi-phase assault executed by a large group of Valkyries who have been called in for backup. After a concentrated barrage of fire from above, three Valkyries charge in with their bayonets then join in the circle made by the remaining five to form a halo. Finally, using the halo much like a crosshair, the Valkyries eradicate the enemy forces by unleashing a massive magical energy band reminiscent of the Allfather’s lance directly upon their heads, using it annihilate the enemy forces.

Although this Noble Phantasm uses two less Valkyries than their standard ten strong Ragnarök Lífþrasir, since Fylgja Valkyrie doesn’t utilize a Bounded Field it’s actually stronger in terms of pure firepower.
