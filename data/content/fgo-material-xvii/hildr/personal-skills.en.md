### SMG/SAM66: B

What would you get if you combined runes and the latest in firearm technology? This. Their runes—the Magic Crests of Norse mythology they originally received from the Allfather—have transformed into skills as part of the changes to their Spirit Origins, and their Noble Phantasm Gungnir has evolved into this weapon as a result.

Neither the Valkyries themselves nor Scáthach-Skadi know why it has taken this form (the shape of a gun), but it’s possible a certain Divine Spirit——Allfather Odin got carried away and instead of simply watching from a higher dimension made it so.

### Valkyrie Group Combat: B+

An advanced technique in which several Valkyries fly out together to engage in serious group combat. Their teamwork is so perfect it could be argued they are all functioning as a single unit, or even that it approaches the realm of Mystics. Although only one of the six sisters can have a Spirit Origin, when said Valkyrie deploys to do battle, two additional Valkyries also deploy to support her, thereby creating a group combat situation. This applies even when their Noble Phantasm’s True Name has not been released.

The two additional Valkyries are treated as a type of continuously active Noble Phantasm.

### Valkyrie Talk: EX

Conversations between sisters reunited after a long time. A peaceful moment that might have once existed in the Scandinavia of the past. A fleeting moment of Mystics that we’ll likely never see again.
