### Jet Sandanzuki

The miraculous single hit emitted by over-boosting the super MAKOTO DRIVE engine installed in the jetpack. Extreme jet acceleration beyond the physical limitations of any person causes the three-stage thrust to execute at sublight speed, which results in its velocity consuming the surrounding air and induces an outrageous power output that swallows up and annihilates the target’s surroundings, despite it being a single target attack. Due to the over-the-limit load it puts on the user, it can cause incapacitation at random.

By the way, sometimes when serious, she yells out “Blue Sky Sandanzuki”, but she herself isn’t really sure what “blue sky” is supposed to mean.

A festive punch-like version of the Noble Phantasm similar to the one Saber Okita Souji has.
For the purpose of exterminating the outlaw ronin rampaging the summer’s sea, various misunderstood Shinsengumi soldiers are summoned. Saitou wears diving goggles and speedos, Yamanami looks all gloomy under a parasol, Serizawa sports an aloha shirt, and so on.
