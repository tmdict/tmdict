### Jet Ten’nen Rishin-ryū: A+

The lone swordswoman who has mastered the lone backwater galaxy’s legendary sword style, Jet Ten’nen Rishin-ryū. It’s also to be said that nobody else wanted to master it. That’s all just space gossip, though.

The instantaneous velocity is ranked among the top ten...or maybe top twenty within the Milky Way. At least, I want it to be in the upper ranks.

### Eye of the Mind (J): A-

In addition to her instinctual sixth sense for evading danger and her natural inclination to detect it as well, her jetpack OS, called the MIBURO System, enables her to predict the immediate future, transmitting that information directly to her brain. But since she is an intuitive-type man-slayer, the whole thing can be kind of a hindrance sometimes.

### M-Drive: EX

A mysterious engine included in the operating system that simulates all types of battles against various outlaw ronin and anti-shogunate space rebels. While it’s possible to draw out power that surpasses her body’s ability whenever she goes into overdrive, it would cause her body to be dangerously vulnerable to collapse because of the extreme strain.
