Boneless Man.
A Noble Phantasm named after the spear that is said to be able to cleave humans so easily they seemed boneless. A powerful, but simple, Noble Phantasm with low magical energy cost, that, as the tale goes, has the ability to render all the target’s defensive abilities null. Usually takes the shape of a straight-spear, but it also has a second form as a jumonji-yari, that can be deployed as long as his offensive capacity has increased.
