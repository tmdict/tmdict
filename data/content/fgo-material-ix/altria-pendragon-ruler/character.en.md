### Personality

Fundamentally the same person as when she was Lancer.
However, because she is off duty she subconsciously thinks that she can spread her wings a bit, and her speech and conduct are a little lax in areas that are unrelated to the Swimsuit Blademaster Official Bout.

### Attitude towards Master

Fundamentally the same person as when she was Lancer, but…
The Master is not a swimsuit blademaster, so they are carelessly caught off guard (油断している, “being careless/unprepared”).
To be more specific, the percentage of smiles showing is slightly higher than usual [when they are a Lancer]. Though only just a little.

### Dialogue Examples

“Now then, let the duel commence (デュエルスタート, lit. duel start)”

“To be honest I’m actually dressed as a rabbit, could you tell?”

“Oh, you’ve noticed then. Yes, that’s right. This umbrella is a different modified form of Rhongomyniad.”

“Casino Camelot, isn’t it so. It feels more like a garden than a castle. Castles are meant to function for battle, but gardens are supposed to be a space for repose. You too, please feel free to relax and make yourself at home.”

### Character Image

Swimsuit Lion King.
There are three meanings behind that name.
First, the manager{{n1}} of Casino Camelot, the apex of the five great casinos which reign over dazzling Las Vegas.
Second, the organizer of the bout match of the Swimsuit Blademasters — Tournament of the Seven Swimsuit Blademasters, who watches over the swimsuit blademasters competing with their swimsuits and their swords for a single summer’s memory.
Third, Lancer Artoria, who has changed into a summer outfit.
Please note, this is a completely different individual from the so-called “Lion King” or “Goddess Rhongomyniad.”

Since the foundation of the Saint Graph is from her time as Lancer, she is still a heavenly/divine Heroic Spirit close to (being) a Divine Spirit, or Goddess.

Her class is Ruler.
Of course, it would be a class for the purpose of arbitrating the match of the swimsuit blademasters.

Furthermore, her favored horse Dun Stallion is not by her side as she is no longer a Lancer.
The white horse has not disappeared, having been sighted resting in the stable area of Chaldea. What about the magical energy to manifest within the present world? That remains unknown.
Though she no longer has her favorite horse, she instead has come to control a lion of light.

With her natural competitive intuition, insight, and mental fortitude, she reigns as Vegas’ strongest dealer.
Before her, any foul play is seen through, and any lucky player are brought to their knees.

The Swimsuit Lion King, Artoria Ruler, intends to enjoy this vacation to the fullest.
This is a rare occurrence.
Because, fundamentally she is a Heroic Spirit who is always combat-ready at all times, never off duty, and diligently and earnestly keeps on fighting.
However, concerning that…
due to the mischievous machination of the mysterious older brother Merlin, she has become a Swimsuit Lion King who tackles this vacation with all her strength.

Master must be mindful.
She is serious.
With her usual solemnity (overly serious demeanor), once she has made up her mind about enjoying the vacation earnestly, she would absolutely not cut any corners at all.
Now then…with your whole body and soul! Play!

### General Armaments

Card Attack (1st and 3rd) / Attack with Parasol (2nd ascension) / Attack with Radiant Lion (appears with EX attack in each ascension)

### Connections with Characters

#### Swimsuit Hokusai

Novel swimsuit blademaster.
How will she fight and how will she shine?
I had high hopes…… and she has lived up to them.

#### Swimsuit Blademasters

Fufu. Really, all of them are highly skilled/peculiar people (くせ者).
It’s been a noisy summer vacation, but judging from Master’s expression, it seems they all did a good job.

#### Knights of the Round Table

The knights who gathered for the sake of managing the casino. Their loyalty, is splendid.
However they truly did work well.
I’ll have to think of a bonus.

#### Moriarty

You’re a fine bartender.

#### Arthur Pendragon

Apparently, he had a sentiment he wished to share concerning bunnies, but it was terribly inarticulate.
Wait. Finish what you were saying, Arthur!

#### Mordred

Hm…?

#### Jekyll

I humbly ask for your continued support.

#### Gareth

(I want to stroke her head to my heart’s content, but I cannot because I am worried about the knights of the round table around me)
