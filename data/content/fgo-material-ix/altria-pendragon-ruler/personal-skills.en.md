### Royal Bunny: A

Look at the thing shining above the king’s head, what is that! Ears like that of an animal!
Could it possibly be some kind of curse or the grudge of the howling Beast Glatisant (唸る獣, “Growling Beast”{{n1}}) that appeared in Britain long ago, which now afflicts King Arthur. How terrifying, the growling beast, oh, to bare its fangs at the king even after the passing of hundreds of years…
ー Nay, that is incorrect. Our king has simply come to harbor an interest in the thing known as bunny girls.
Oh? Then that getup, could it possibly be.
ー Yes. A costume.
So that’s it.

### Royal Card: C+

That which the King seems to be a throwing does not appear to be a kind of dagger, no. Is that a card? — Yes. As a casino dealer, one must be exceptional in the handling of cards, as per the king’s decree. Is it not a wonderful skill.
At times, I have heard this place called as a casino being as for amusement.
— That’s right.
Though the manner of throwing seems as if she has the intention of annihilating enemies in mind.— Perhaps it is something as intended to drive off inebriated guests and the like.
Is that so…

### Knight of the Lion: B

It is said that in the past, Sir Ywain fought alongside a lion.
Thus, it is no wonder that as his liege, our king, is able to command a lion of light. Or possibly, at the time of the Saint Graph changing, the King purposefully selected as her own the skill that should have been originally possessed by Sir Ywain.
― That may also be the case.
Yes.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} [Questing Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questing_Beast), or the Beast Glatisant (Barking Beast), is a monster from Arthurian legend. It is the subject of quests undertaken by famous knights such as King Pellinore, Sir Palamedes, and Sir Percival. The strange creature has the head and neck of a snake, the body of a leopard, the haunches of a lion and the feet of a hart. Its name comes from the great noise it emits from its belly, a barking like “thirty couple hounds questing”. ‘Glatisant’ is related to the French word glapissant, ‘yelping’ or ‘barking’, especially of small dogs or foxes.
