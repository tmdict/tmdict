Le Rêve Ensoleillé
A silent and mellow assassination as performed by the one hailed as the Angel of Assassination; Charlotte Corday.
Not before the very precipice of one’s murder, can even a single drop of murderous intent be felt.
It is hard to avoid through Intuition or Eye of the Mind, unlike other kinds of assassination Noble Phantasms.
