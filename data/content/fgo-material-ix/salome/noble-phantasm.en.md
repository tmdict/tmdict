Femme Fatale Baiser (Lethal Woman’s Kiss). Its outward appearance is that of a skull made of crystal. A trophy Salome attained at the end of much yearning, insanity and fresh blood; that is to say, the crystallized head of John the Baptist. Although it is normally in a hand-held size, it is possible for it to enlarge/reduce its size freely according to Salome’s intentions. John the Baptist possesses legends where he used various Magecrafts, so that head is a clump of Mystery, converted into a Magecraft Mystic Code of sorts. It seems it becomes possible for the owner of that head to use various Magecraft————even if, they do not contain Magic Circuits within their body.

At the moment of its True Name Release, this crystal skull will considerably enlarge, before preying upon Salome’s opponent. If Salome reaches the limit of her Saint Graph Ascension, the skull will transform from a skull made of crystal into a skull made of gold.
