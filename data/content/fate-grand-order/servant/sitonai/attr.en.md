This Heroic Spirit is a fusion of several Divine Spirits all in the body of a certain girl with a close connection to the Holy Grail. How exactly this was accomplished is similar to the summoning of Pseudo-Servants like Zhuge Liang, although her particular manifestation combines characteristics of a High Servant (a compounding of multiple heroes) and an Alter Ego (the distillation of a certain personality facet).

The one who became the vessel was not a human mage, but rather the latest model of homunculus created by the Einzberns. Her enormous Command Spell covered her entire body, her talent in magecraft was top class, and her abilities as a Master were even greater. In addition, she also functioned as the container of the Lesser Grail.

The True Name recorded for her Spirit Origin is “Sitonai,” as she is the most prominent of the three Divine Spirits gathered in this vessel.
