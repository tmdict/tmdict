The goddess of the underworld in Sumerian mythology.
She wields a spear-shaped cage, capable of skewering her enemies, trapping souls, and summoning lightning at will. She is the ruler of the underworld, and is to be feared.
From the day of her birth, she was entrusted with the governance of the underworld. When the Age of Gods ended, she disappeared without ever knowing the surface world or freedom.
In this form, she has manifested not as the goddess Ereshkigal, but as a Pseudo-Servant whose vessel is the soul of a human girl who shared certain characteristics with her.
She claims her job is simply to watch over the souls of humans as befits a goddess of the underworld. She does, however, have this complaint:
“…I really don’t like it when too many people flock to the underworld all at once. Making cages to trap souls is a pain…and I’m not sure if I can make this place comfortable for everyone…”
As you can see, she doesn’t do a spectacular job of hiding just how much she likes taking care of people.
She is truly the underworld’s (red) angel.
