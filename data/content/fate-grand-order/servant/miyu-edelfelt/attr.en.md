An elementary school student who attends Homurahara Academy with Illya and Chloe. She forms a contract with the Kaleidostick Magical Sapphire to become the second Magical Girl. (It may be more accurate to say she was forced into it…)

As she has no family, she is adopted by Luvia and takes on the name Edelfelt, living as their maid.

Though her knowledge of physics and mathematics is at a university level, her communication skills lag substantially behind her age group. It is Illya who becomes her first friend.
It seems that Miyu doesn’t know the difference between friendship and love, switching instantly from aloof and distant to overly clingy, but Illya accepts her anyway and returns her friendship. Through the cycle of daily life and bizarre adventures, the two become best friends.

Also, it seems that Miyu sees Chloe as a rival for Illya’s affection.
