An artificial Heroic Spirit molded by Da Vinci. She’s just a ball of energy and quite precocious! She is an innocent and beautiful hybrid Servant, who zooms through the battlefield on roller skates and utilizes her Ultimo Manipulator from her Universal Bag to fight.

“Huh? So who exactly am I, you ask? Obviously, the universal genius Leonardo da Vinci had a clone of herself ready in the case of a second Grand Order, who is now the world’s most beautiful and capable secretary-type who supports and helps Chaldea’s Master…
I’m everyone’s favorite girl, Da Vinci!”
