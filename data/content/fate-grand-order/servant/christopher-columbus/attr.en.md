A man in his prime who has tasted both the sweet and bitter fruits of life.
He constantly says to never give up on what’s important, encouraging others with a slap on the back whenever they are feeling down.
A man who never loses his cool.
His fearless smile never disappears.

…He knows.
As long as he keeps moving forward, he will one day reach the destination that he hopes for.
