A princess of Greek myth, Europa is best known as one of the many consorts of Zeus, the king of the Olympian gods. She is the daughter of the Phoenician King Agenor and Queen Telephassa, though some say that she is instead the daughter of Agenor’s son, Phoenix. Whatever her lineage, the fact remains that she was born a princess.

Europa received three gifts from Zeus: a bronze Tálos, a hunting dog, and a javelin. After her death, Europa was deified, and the white bull that carried her on its back later became the constellation Taurus. One theory holds that Europa’s name is the origin of the name of the continent Europe.
