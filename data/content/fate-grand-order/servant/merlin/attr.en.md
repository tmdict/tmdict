The vagabond of paradise. The court wizard, prophet, and adviser from the Legend of King Arthur. He would sometimes guide, sometimes cause trouble for, and sometimes aid King Arthur as he fought against his many enemies and overcame his many trials. He was a sage, but fundamentally not human. He was, in fact, a half-blood born of a human and an incubus.

“I love the world of humans, but as for individual humans, well, um… you know! Yep! Okay, I’m starting to think it’s better left unsaid!”

As you can see, he’s not particularly an ally of mankind.
He is one of the strongest Casters, but he isn’t very good at magecraft. Why? Because he gets tongue-tied when chanting spells, you see.
