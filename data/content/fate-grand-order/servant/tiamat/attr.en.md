One of the gods who created the world in Mesopotamian myth. The gods were born from Abzu (fresh water) and Tiamat (salt water).
Afterward, the gods rebelled against their father, Abzu, and gained control of the world.
When this happened, Tiamat kindly watched over her children. This was proof that her love for her children exceeded her love for their father.

However, the gods eventually turned their blades on even Tiamat. She mourned and went mad, and created the monstrous Eleven Offspring of Tiamat to battle the gods.
At the end of the battle, Tiamat and her Eleven Offspring lost.
The gods split her corpse in two to make the heavens and the earth. This is said to be the ritual that created the human world.
