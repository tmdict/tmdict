Sei Shounagon’s father was Kiyohara-no-Motosuke, one of the scholars of the Five Men of the Pear Chamber who helped to compile the kun-doku (the Japanese reading of Chinese characters) version of the “Manyoshu” waka poem anthology.
She was a woman of outstanding intellect whose forward behavior (some would say “unorthodox") made her stand out in the male-dominated society of her lifetime.
She faithfully served Empress Teishi, consort of Emperor Ichijou, until the Empress’s death. The many prose writings Sei Shounagon wrote in offering to Empress Teishi were later collected to become “Makura-no-Soushi.” (The Pillow Book)
