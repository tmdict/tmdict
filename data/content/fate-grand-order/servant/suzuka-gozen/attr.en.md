A court dancer said to have worked alongside Sakanoue-no-Tamuramaro, hunting oni from their stronghold on Mount Suzuka.
Because of her beauty and strength, she was rumored to be both a celestial maiden and an oni. In truth, she is the beloved daughter of the Demon King of the Fourth Heaven, sent on a mission to the human world.
Her orders were to make Japan a land of demons, but she felt causing conflict for mere humans was beneath her. Instead, she went on countless adventures, but her tale of romance came to an abrupt end with her death at the hands of her own lover, Sakanoue-no-Tamuramaro.
Truly, she is the heavenly princess of tragic love. In search of ultimate beauty, she concluded that the latest and greatest look was…

“High school girl style, duh!
A shrine maiden was a good option too, but like, nothing says ’love’ like a high school girl!”

…Um, young lady? Are you SURE that’s what you want?
