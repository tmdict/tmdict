Asclepius is a Greek hero who trained under Chiron, from whom he learned the art of medicine. He would later be known as the god of medicine and was also among the Argonauts Jason led.

As the son of Apollo, Asclepius’s proficiency in medicine was so great that he gained the power to resurrect the dead. However, the gods saw his power as a threat, so Zeus struck Asclepius down with one of his thunderbolts.
