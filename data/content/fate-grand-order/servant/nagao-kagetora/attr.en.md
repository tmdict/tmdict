Nagao Kagetora was the daimyo of the Echigo region during the Warring States period. Her reputation as an unparalleled warrior led to her being known as “God of War” in later years. Claiming to be the avatar of Bishamonten, she fought honorably to unify the nation during this turbulent time, and spent almost her entire life on the battlefield.
“One does not engage in battle for self-gain. But should your reasons be just, all shall aid in your cause!”
