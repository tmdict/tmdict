A powerful knight and man of unparalleled beauty who wields two demonic swords and demonic spears. He was raised by Aengus, the fairy king and god of love, and Manannán, the god of the sea. Diarmuid was a member of Fionn mac Cumhaill’s Knights of Fianna, and is said to have performed great feats when the knightly order fought alongside the fairy king Abarthach.

As he was a master of the sword as well as the spear, he was able to manifest here as a Saber. His Saber Spirit Origin emphasizes his aspect as a hero of myth and legend. It is much more costly and difficult to summon him as a Saber than as a Lancer, presumably because he possesses multiple Noble Phantasms of almost godly power.
