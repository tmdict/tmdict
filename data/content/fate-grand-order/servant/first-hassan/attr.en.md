An assassin in a skull mask.
With the creation of the cult of assassins, the name “Old Man of the Mountain” became a hereditary title.
He is said to have been the first Hassan-i Sabbah.
But the other 18 Hassans and the other members of the cult don’t know his true identity, nor is there any evidence that he actually existed.
When a Hassan-i Sabbah deviates from the path, this legendary assassin arrives to take their head.
He is the Hassan who kills Hassans.
