The summer form of the Goddess of Venus, Ishtar.
After witnessing the enthusiasm of people during summer festivals and being moved by the peoples’ devotion, she decided to host a great event of her own. She is truly a goddess among goddesses.
Riding Maanna, the Boat of Heaven, which has been modified to look more modern, she is a kung fu goddess who nimbly and acrobatically darts around.

“Is everyone having fun!? Everything awesome!?
Yep, yep! Good, good!
Keep trying until you reach your limit!”

As you can see, she is quite friendly and so very generous. She is truly a benevolent goddess who blesses all in attendance of her event.

Behind that smile, what’s REALLY going on in that head of hers?
