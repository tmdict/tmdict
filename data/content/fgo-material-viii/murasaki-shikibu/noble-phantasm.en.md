> “Per tradition,
> the color of my clothes

> But from the tears on my sleeve
> forms an abyss bottomless.”

The poem recited along with the True Name Release works as a form of hex, inviting ruin to the target(s).
It damages and weakens the target(s).

This waka poem was published in the The Hollyhocks, the 9th tome of The Tale of Genji.
It is a poem of regret recited by Hikaru Genji as his wife Aoi no Ue dies immediately after giving birth to their son Yuugiri. Aoi no Ue’s death was caused by the grudge from Genji’s former lover Rokujou no Miasundokoro. In short, she was killed by a form of curse.
By reciting this poem of sorrow so tied to grudge and deadly curse, Caster Murasaki Shikibu laments her target’s fate. That is, their fate to lie down on the ground after facing defeat.

By the way, the chapters related to Aoi no Ue’s death later became the source material for the Noh play Aoi no Ue.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} According to my research, there are 4 official translations to The Tale of Genji, so I really don’t have a fixed translation reference I must follow for the chapter names and poems in the Noble Phantasms. Instead I’m mostly taking reference from my own copy of the book, which is the Portuguese translation by Carlos Correia Monteiro de Oliveira and adjusting it into English on my own.
