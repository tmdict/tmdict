Her base look is in the image of a Japanese traditional doll and a Zashiki-warashi. From there, within the realm of ‘that which might plausibly exist in fairytale illustrations’, I added things like a sparrow Enma crown, a sparrow straw raincoat, a sparrow cook’s apron, a tokin{{n1}} horn that’s like the beak of a sparrow, a long sword which’s size does not fit her, tall pokkuri getas{{n2}} and a short-length flame-patterned long-sleeved kimono…and done!…oh my, how cute! And that’s how the process went. The lisp I scribbled down for no special reason has apparently been adopted into her setting. (Harada Takehito)

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} A tokin is a small black box worn on the foreheads of Yamabushi - practitioners of Shugendō (Japanese mountain asceticism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) - or Tengu, dangerous yet protective spirits of the mountains and forests from the Japanese mythology.
2. {{note2}} Pokkuri getas are very tall wooden sandals worn by maiko during their apprenticeship.
