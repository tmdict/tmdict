### Tactician’s Advice: A

A skill bestowed to all tactician Servants.

Through having a good grasp and analysis of any situation, she is capable of giving the correct advice to her allies.

The higher the skill rank, the higher the accuracy of the advice given. With an A-rank skill, all advice will hit the mark 100% with the exception of unforeseen catastrophes.

To counter this, one must possess luck and skills capable of breaking down all sorts of analyses.

### Emperor Xuan of Jin‘s Command: A

A variation of the “Tactician’s Command” skill bestowed to tactician Servants. 

Sima Yi was a usurper and was posthumously honored with the title Emperor Xuan of Jin. His skill as a tactician and his skill as an emperor have fused.

This skill changes one’s existence, as well as brings out an army’s strength to the fullest.

### Supreme Mystic Code: Volumen Hydrargyrum (Marrow of the Moon Spirit): B

A Supreme Mystic Code of the Archibald family of the El-Melloi faction, one of the twelve noble families of the Clock Tower.
