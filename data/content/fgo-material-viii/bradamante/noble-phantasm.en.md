### Bouclier d’Atlantes: Dazzlingly Beautiful is the Flashing Magic Shield of Light

Bouclier d’Atlantes (Shield of Atlantes). A magic shield that had once been owned by the evil mage Atlantes, who had abducted Bradamante’s lover, Rogero. The shield can emit an intense light of magical energy by means of its True Name Release, causing damage to it targets while also forcing them to undergo a Stun Check. Even if they end up not being stunned at the conclusion of their Check, by having their eyes blinded by the light, their Agility Parameter would be temporarily lowered considerably.

Furthermore, one should not primarily strike with a shield. Yet for Bradamante, it appears that her spirits are rising too high on the occasion of her materialization in the present world, so after dazzling her targets with the light emitted from her shield, she almost unconsciously rushes forward to strike at them with it.

It has been said that Bradamante, who defeated Atlantes, obtained the shield the latter owned and even got the Phantasmal Beast Hippogriff he rode on too. (If she was summoned in the Rider Class, the Hippogriff would fully come along with her for sure.)

### Angelica Cathay: Resplendently Beautiful is the Ring of the Pretty Princess

A mysterious ring that had once been owned by Angelica, a beautiful princess of a foreign country whom both Roland and Bradamante’s elder brother Renaud – whom both are part of the Twelve Peers – had fallen in love with. It is said that it has the power to nullify any and all magecraft. It has been arranged so that Bradamante would possess this ring because of a hapless fate, and she greatly applied the ring’s powers at the time of extricating her lover Rogero from the evil mage Atlantes.

The reason why the rank in Bradamante’s Magical Resistance Skill – which should originally be around Rank C – is being changed to Rank A, and why the Magic Cancellation Skill is being endowed to her, is because of this Noble Phantasm’s effect. Upon releasing its True Name, it flips up Bradamante’s as well as her whole group’s defensive power towards magecraft. It is also primarily endowed with the power to “conceal one’s figure”. From the way it seems, on the occasion of this current materialization, Bradamante is charging the magical energy of this ring into her spear she holds in her right hand, raising her combat power against magical entities.
