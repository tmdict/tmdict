No Second Strike.
Just like Tsubame Gaeshi, or God Spear No Second Strike, this is a technique forged and mastered to the point where it’s become a Noble Phantasm.
It’s effect is the same as his Lancer version’s ‘God Spear No Second Strike’, but due to being done using his bare hands, the range has been reduced to only his fists’ reach.

Fierce Tiger Climbs the Mountain.
One of Baji Quan’s master techniques sublimated as a Noble Phantasm.
…However, the reason it can’t currently solidify into a single form might be due to the technique’s form varying between the many different schools of Baji Quan.
This is the technique Li Shuwen was most proficient at.

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} His FGO profile doesn’t mention its actual effect, but luckily the Fate/Extra materials do:
  “No Second Strike was strictly anti-personnel…an attack for stopping a person’s heart, but this attack is specialized for physical damage.
  It’s a series of consecutive attacks and frequently uses motions where the first attack looks like a tiger clawing at a mountain.
  Each single attack is “energy from the earth outputted through the martial artist Li Shuwen” to easily smash walls, doors, and even the sturdy gates of dojos, let alone the damage it could cause to a single person.”
