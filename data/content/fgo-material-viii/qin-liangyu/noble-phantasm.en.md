A spear made of ash that Qin Liangyu was said to have been habitually using together with her subordinates. While there are no anecdotes about the spear itself, it has the effect of instilling some fear into anti-hero Servants.

It has been told that ash was used as a material for spears in Greece far and wide, and that Achilles’ spear was also made from ash.

The four pieces of Chinese poetry presented to Qin Liangyu by the Chongzhen Emperor, the reigning Emperor back then in the former’s time period. When she was summoned to the capital, Qin Liangyu thought that she would have to take responsibility for the failure of subjugating bandits, so she chose to prepare herself by giving away her own funds to her subordinates, but she was presented with a reward and four poems instead by the Emperor himself, the four poems giving praise to her, which were said to have been made by the Emperor.
