TMdict Turns 10!

In 2015, we launched a small dictionary website called TMdict. Ten years later, the site is still going strong — continuing to serve as a valuable resource for the community. Over the past decade, TMdict has gone through many changes and iterations. To celebrate our 10th anniversary, we're giving the website a complete overhaul:

- CHALDEAの記録 has been merged into the main site, so all glossaries and profile translations are now available side by side.

- We've introduced a faster, more modern design with improved usability — including small enhancements like a brand-new dark mode. (If you miss the old design, you can still access it in our <a href="../legacy/en/index.html">legacy archive</a>).

- The backend has been rebuilt using the SvelteKit framework, enabling easier development and allowing us to take advantage of modern tools to improve the user experience.

Finally, we want to express our heartfelt thanks to the community for its continued support, and to all the translators who have contributed to our ever-growing database.
