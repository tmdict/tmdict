One of the five existing Magicians. It seems she hates the alliteration in her full name, and gets mad when people call her by it.
As for why she’s a Magician, it’s because she arrived there at the end of a long and arduous road. If that’s not a clear answer for you, please refer to *Kara no Kyoukai*. However, Aoko merely arrived there, and was utterly clueless as to where or what it is.
She had such a large influence on the young Shiki that to this day she is the only person he calls “Sensei.”
The story of *Tsukihime* begins with Aoko and Shiki’s first meeting. At that time, she seemed to be an amiable older-sister type, but generally her stance is to avoid getting too involved with other people.
Ever since becoming the Aozaki heir, she has lived the life of a rootless wanderer, roaming the world with a single trunk in hand. Her meeting with Shiki was merely a coincidence, akin to making friends with a local child in the midst of a long journey.
Within the Association, she is known as the Magic Gunner, Miss Blue. Her abilities as a magus are below average, but there are none more talented when it comes to destruction.
Though she is an important person to Tohno Shiki, she only has a minor role in the story of *Tsukihime*. The incident where she takes the leading role is a story for another time.
In *Melty Blood Re-ACT*, she appears as a hidden boss. As expected of someone with the nickname Magic Gunner, it’s like fighting a living artillery battery. Also, maybe it’s because she’s not really taking it seriously, but her apathetic voice is pretty great. At first the production staff was a bit doubtful about the performance, particularly her monotonous “Oh, I guess I lost,” but eventually it grew on them. A lot.
