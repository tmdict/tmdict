### Personality (Ascension 1)

Chaotic Good.
Extroverted, positive and active. As part of the ruthless True Ancestor royalty, she does not exhibit any human-like emotions. Rather than that of a princess, her demeanor and tone is more befitting of a queen, treating the insolent with no mercy. While she coldly views human culture as being foolish and pathetic, she does not dislike nor deny it. “It is impressive, in its own unique way. Comedies can sometimes be beautiful when taken to extremes.” After living for millennia without much change, it has grown easy for new stimuli to get a reaction out of her. Despite seeming morose and unfeeling, she’s a funny queen that looks forward to unexpected coincidences. 

### Personality (Ascension 2)

Neutral Good.
Introverted, positive and active. Since her physical appearance has remained that of a young woman in her late teens, her mental maturity has also not progressed. She has a refreshed personality that doesn’t sweat the small stuff. She gained her naive persona after being killed by a certain human, but her abundance of knowledge and rationality as a True Ancestor still remains; the result being an easygoing yet intellectual nature.

A dynamic person that will drag around the one she’s interested in as much as she pleases. Due to her exceptionally one track mind (by design), even she gets frustrated over her extreme refusal to change a decision she’s set on. She wears her emotions on her sleeve, prone to sulking when she loses. With that said, she’ll still hold back her objections, albeit reluctantly. She fundamentally enjoys conversation, but will not pry into others.

A firm believer in consequentialism, she’ll push through any obstacle to achieve the ideal outcome, human morals and common sense not even entering the equation. Her desire for control and to rule over the things she likes is strong.

She may be a self-proclaimed vampire, but she does not suck the blood of humans. Her dislikes are blood, herself sucking blood, Roa, and anyone who’d hurt her lover. She doesn’t mind if her lover gets with someone else though, as long as he’s not being harmed. With that said… despite it being extremely rare, there’s a certain exception that she definitely will not accept. A funny vamp that sprung forth from a fateful encounter.

### Personality (Ascension 3)

Chaotic Good.
Introverted, positive and passive. A form younger than Ascension 1, this princess of the True Ancestors has yet to experience the outer world. While her human-like emotions remain scarce, they are assuredly beginning to develop. Having been raised as a princess, she isn’t particularly eager to speak to the common folk. The insolent are treated with no mercy (as she has not learnt conversation etiquette) but she’s not as aggressive as in Ascension 1. Graceful in speech and conduct, her consideration for others, slight though it may be, is evident. She despises how the surface is, but the truth is she just doesn’t really understand human culture. A funny princess.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

She views her appearance in Chaldea as a consequence of their existence. She does not accord the Master any special privileges as their contractor, nor does she address them with the title of ‘Master.’ This does not imply a dislike for the protagonist; on the contrary, she is exceptionally amicable and cooperative. The Arcueid who has manifested is a version ‘post-malfunction,’ resulting in an unconditional fondness for all of humanity.

### Character Image

Elemental royalty are known as the True Ancestors. As their Princess, she may not have any special abilities, but boasts high specs in every aspect. Simple is best. Unlike Dead Apostles who were once human, True Ancestors are endowed with their predetermined abilities from birth, and are unable to improve them through the sucking of blood. Even amongst unworldly True Ancestors, her abilities are top class. A mediocre vampire has no chance of defeating her.

However, being a True Ancestor is synonymous with being unable to restrain their craving for blood. She uses her immense power, 70% of it, to seal her own vampiric urges.

In addition to matching her performance to the enemy, she is also skilled at mental interference with her Mystic Eyes as well as reconstructing the world with Marble Phantasm.

Her immunity to the sun and the ability to regenerate are both functions that occur naturally to her. In both her 1st and 3rd Ascensions, she views battle as a ‘competition to create, combine and control different elements’.

In the world of Tsukihime, the strongest existence of a celestial body is known as the Ultimate One (Original One), a position that the awakened Arcueid is applicable for. However, until things are settled with Altrouge, a being ‘that forms the celestial’ on the same scale, she cannot be referred to as the ‘ONE’.

### Dialogue Examples

“Servant, is it? Name I have none, though character I do… Verily, I bid thee address me by ‘Original One’. That I have been called forth no doubt signifies fate at work. Why, I may as well observe thine existences meanwhile. Juuust kidding! Let’s get rid of whatever that pompous me was trying to say! Hello, Chaldea-person! I’m the Moon Cancer Arcueid Brunestud! I hope we can get along! As soon as I’m in my second Ascension we’ll meet again!”

“Even if thou art my summoner, I shan’t permit insolence. Worry not, ‘tis not difficult. Know thy manners—prove thy fidelity—and forget not to grow. Do this, and I shall surely wear a gentle visage.”

“Thanks for waiting! I went from the stuffy archetype me to the carefree princess me—changing mode from old me to new me! You wanna defend the Human Order, right? I’ll take care of it! Again, nice to meet you, Master!”

“Both magecraft and sacraments imitate and then recreate the things possible to achieve on the planet, right? Meaning, they don’t really have much effect on me, as I serve as its foundation. Conversely, devious curses born solely from human society are rare, so those might work. “

“Things like internet magecraft, or modern magecraft—so dismissed by mages at large—would maybe stand a chance against me.”

“It is not that I don’t understand how to order, but rather that I don’t know what each of the ordered drinks are like. I cannot just imbibe something of an unknown nature. I do not wish to act in error, you see.”

“Finally, someone with some sense. I am pleased to make your acquaintance, human. I am Archetype: Earth. This may be sudden, but may I request you escort me through this city?”

### Character Image in Tsukihime

Around the year 1200, a True Ancestor with near-perfect stats was created to eliminate fallen True Ancestors.

While she was ‘created’, it wasn’t through artificial means. Like her brethren, she was born naturally. Originally conceived as a ‘template of royalty,’ her extraordinary capabilities, far surpassing those of other True Ancestors, were swiftly recognized. As a result, she was rapidly adapted to serve as a combatant specifically designed to counter fallen True Ancestors.

As True Ancestors are Elementals extracted from the planet, how they are born is wholly dependent on nature. Thus, the nascent Arcueid was instilled with combat knowledge and rigorously trained. (Individuals born as True Ancestors royalty are rare. Only three, including Arcueid, possess the title of Brunestud)

Henceforth, she was awakened only to engage the fallen True Ancestors, vanquishing her designated targets before returning to slumber, repeating this cycle.

However, during this cycle, she was beguiled by a mage named Roa, succumbing to the urge to consume human blood and triggering a frenzy in which she slaughtered the True Ancestors who had raised her. Having regained her composure, she self-imposed imprisonment within the Millennium Castle.

Intending to remain in eternal slumber, she discovered the existence of Roa, the one who had brought about her downfall. From that point on, she would emerge from the Millennium Castle whenever Roa was reincarnated, exacting retribution and then returning to her slumber. Having experienced nothing but combat, she was a killing machine that never engaged in anything ‘pointless’.

…But this changed when she set foot into a Japanese city in pursuit of Roa, where she was killed by a human and then revived. It was such a shock to her that rage, confusion, obsession and admiration erupted within, eventually morphing her into an innocent vampiress.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The special guest of FGO’s seventh anniversary. While essentially Arcueid from Tsukihime, she appears in Fate worlds under the official name Archetype: Earth, as the brain of the planet. The second Saint Graph’s Arcueid Brunestud is from three years after a certain route in Tsukihime: A piece of blue glass moon.

### Connections with Characters

#### Ryougi Shiki

‘Tis a hole that leads unto the Fount—a will born in an empty vessel. I suppose such things can occur. Verily, thou harbourest dreams in the heart rather than the brain. ‘Tis primitive, yet beautiful—’tis so, but thou art rather too vicious! Why dost thou swing thy sword about? Cease dishevelling the flower garden!

#### Kukulkan

She maye be of an alien species, but ne’ertheless an Archetype all the same. We are something akin to sisters… or mayhaps akin to sister cities? Even so, our prædilections are complete opposites. I swear it that I will never act as easy-going as she, dost thou hear me?

#### Tohno Shiki

’Speaking purely hypothetically, what if Tohno Shiki was summoned here?’ I mean, do you even have to ask?! Whether it’s Shiki in a good mood, or Shiki with all kinds of complicated things going on, one thing is clear; both are dangerous killers, okay?! Leave the next fight to me and him, please! I’m going out to battle together with Shiki~!

#### Mysterious Executor C.I.E.L

No comment.

Koyanskaya of Light
The beast born from the slaughter of the land. The Evil of Man whose pride did not allow itself to become a Beast—despite being one of such vessels. To bear feelings so strong they prevent your own completion… I wonder if I will ever know love that powerful?

#### Goetia

Goetia, the First Beast. He who attempted to surpass the breadth of the planet via Retroflow. What a foolish deed…  No matter how much energy or fortuity you manage to gather up, celestial conception cannot be achieved by that which is not an egg.
