### Magic Resistance: A+

Interference techniques created by civilisation are rendered mostly ineffective.

### Item Creation: A

True Ancestors have a unique psychic power named Marble Phantasm, which allows them to create anything that spawns from nature. It is essentially an all-powerful printer that can reproduce any natural occurring flora, minerals and geographical features. Human-made items such as chemical compounds or architecture do not fall under this jurisdiction. However, with the greedy notion that ‘all items originally came from nature anyway’, such things become possible. In such a scenario, the scale and accuracy drops significantly. With that said, something like a whiteboard is child’s play.

### Territory Creation: EX

As the entire planet can be considered to be her territory, she excels at synchronizing with leylines. However, the connection is so strong that the weakening of the land is capable of influencing her as well.

### Independent Action: A

Being an incarnated Elemental, she is able to materialise at her target after a one way trip from the Inner Sea of the Planet. When returning to it, her body will be dispersed.

### Original One: D

Her output and Lifescale increases to become one rank higher than her enemy as a form of backup from the planet. However, as her frame is a Saint Graph instead of the World Egg, this is not exhibited in full. The limit is one or two rank ups for various stats in battle.
