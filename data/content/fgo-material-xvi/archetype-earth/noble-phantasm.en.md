Temporarily transforming her frame into a condensation of mana, she executes an immensely powerful strike with the energy provided by the planet. Rather than interference of nature through magecraft, it is a purely natural phenomenon. In her 2nd Ascension, as a fan of direct frontal assaults, she turns herself into an energy bullet for a bunker buster attack. As True Ancestor royalty (1st Ascension) or the infant of nature (3rd Ascension), it’s her 1200AD self sending an attack across space-time from the Millennium Castle. It possesses a potent anti-Chaotic characteristic, granting additional NP gauge to ‘humans living in the present.’ This includes Servants like Illya, Chloe, Miyu, Sieg, Erice, and Shiki, while excluding those who have essentially fused with their Heroic Spirits, such as Bazett, Ishtar, and Muramasa. In addition, the field is morphed into a materialisation of the Castle. While Archetype: Earth’s parameters should increase by two ranks while on this field, this does not occur due to Chaldea’s summoning methods.
