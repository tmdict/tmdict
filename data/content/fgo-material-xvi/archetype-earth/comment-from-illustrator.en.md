Arcueid is the main heroine of Tsukihime and a figurehead for TYPE-MOON. We approached her implementation for the anniversary with immense enthusiasm, dedicating significant effort to her design and illustration.

The elegant dress of Ascension 1, affectionately known as ‘Princess Arc,’ was designed with the intention of modernizing her for FGO while preserving the essence of her Tsukihime persona. While being flashy is easy, finding the right balance proved to be a delicate task.

For Ascension 2, I presented six preliminary sketches to Kinoko Nasu, ranging from simple to battle-ready and even fantastical. Despite acknowledging the potential for stylistic excess, he ultimately selected the design with the most visual impact.

In Ascension 3, I represented her Luminarification through her flowing hair and her Marble Phantasm with a giant sword, culminating in a regal and orthodox dress aesthetic. The design of her weaponry was entrusted to Shimokoshi. (Takashi Takeuchi)
