### Rainbow Mystic Eyes: A

The highest rank of Mystic Eye: Rainbow. For a single turn, all enemies will have their movement strongly restricted (defense down, skill and NP seal), while her own attack is increased.

### Breath of the Planet: C

A fundamental ability of the A-Ray (Known as A-Reis in a Lostbelt) True Species. Though it seems as if she’s simply taking a deep breath to psych herself up, she’s actually absorbing mana from her surroundings. The generation of internal magical energy and performance increase is comparable to a dragon core. A super buff that increases her NP gauge by 100.

### Funny Vamp: EX

The result of a malfunction that caused her to awaken her own form of love for humanity. An atmosphere that protects the virtuous, earthlight that blooms in profusion. The entire party receives invulnerability and NP gauge increases (distributed from her own), along with buffs for allies with good alignment.
