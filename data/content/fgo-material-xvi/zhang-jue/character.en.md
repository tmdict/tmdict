### Personality

A good-natured old man. Prefers going out to staying in.

Once he sets about his goal of achieving peace throughout the land he becomes an action-oriented shitty old geezer, who doesn’t care about the problems he causes.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

His wish for the Holy Grail is, as expected, peace throughout the land.

“I wish for all the people to live happily” he says his eyes shining

As for Master, now that Zhang Bao and the others are gone, Zhang Jue treats them as a talented person he wants to put under his control. He frequently tries to recruit the Master, saying things like, “The General of Earth and General of the People spots are open, you know?” Though he still would need to recruit one more person to complete the Three Pillars, otherwise the foundation won’t be solid.

Additionally whenever he can Zhang Jue tries to wrap a yellow cloth around Master’s head

“This is the kind of fashion that’s a big hit with the young folks nowadays.”

“I’ve heard of a concept called The Yellow Handkerchief of Happiness. This is basically the same idea.”

Of course, this would inevitably put Master under Zhang Jue’s control so each time it happens either Mash or Da Vinci tell him off with a “You can’t!”. In response, Zhang Jue pretends to be dejected, saying, “To think you wouldn’t grant the request of an elderly man with little time left to live… Oh woe is me…”

Zhang Jue, for his part, has no ill intentions. It’s simply that if the Master were under the Yellow Turban’s manipulation arts in an emergency, he might be able remotely control them out of danger.

“I’m only thinking about what’s best for the Master… Though, admittedly, the idea of using them as the figurehead for the Chaldean forces is also quite tempting…”

“You’re not supposed to say the second part out loud!”

All this being said even if the cloth were to be wrapped around Master due to a derivative of their innate anti-poison skill, they would resist being fully controlled and after a short while the effect would come undone.

### Historical Image · Character Image

Zhang Jue was the founder of the religious organization called the Way of Peace (Taiping Dao), and he led the Yellow Turban Rebellion.

In the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it is said that he met an immortal, who handed him three volumes of a book called The Essential Art of Great Peace (Taipingjing), saying, “Make use of this to make the world a better place. However if you misuse it you will undoubtedly receive divine punishment” Through this, Zhang Jue is said to have mastered mystical arts such as controlling the weather.

Afterward, he began to use fúshuǐ to save people and began calling himself “The Great Teacher”. Those who admired him and revered his teachings quickly grew in number, and his followers became known as the Yellow Turban Army because they wore yellow cloths around their heads.

In 184 AD, these followers, tired of the corrupt Han Dynasty that caused suffering and chaos for the people, finally rose up as a rebel army in an armed insurrection. Zhang Jue proclaimed himself the “General of Heaven” and his younger brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang the “General of Earth” and “General of the People” respectively.

However, the Yellow Turban Army began to lose cohesion and devolved into violent mobs across various regions. The Han Dynasty, appointing He Jin as it’s General-in-Chief, organized a military campaign to suppress the Yellow Turbans and capture Zhang Jue.

Thanks to the efforts of warriors who would later become central figures in The Romance of the Three Kingdoms such as Sun Jian, Cao Cao and Liu Bei the Yellow Turban Army was steadily defeated across the land.

During the conflict, Zhang Jue died of illness. After his death, his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang were also killed, and thus the Yellow Turban Rebellion came to its end.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

Zhang Jue has always hated hearing his Yellow Turbans referred to as “bandits.” He insists that they are nothing of the sort, but rather, ordinary people who came to believe in the Way of the Peace. That said, the Yellow Turbans did harbor a significant secret. As their seemingly impossible numbers would suggest, not every one of them was human. Some were actually puppet soldiers Zhang Jue controlled directly with Taoist arts!

Thanks to his Taipingjing, Zhang Jue learned how to use yellow cloth as a conduit that would give him control over anything the cloth was wrapped around, both living and nonliving. This means that the Yellow Turbans’ three hundred thousand members were not comprised solely of those who believed in the Way of the Peace, but also of mechanical puppet soldiers and people being controlled by such cloth. The puppet soldiers were humanoid, and given to chanting “Azure Sky…dead… Yellow Sky…rises…” as part of their core programming.

Though Zhang Jue’s ends are noble—bringing peace to the world and happiness to all people—he is ruthless in the means he employs. He will resort to using religion, military force, assassinations, cowardly plots…whatever will get the job done. In essence, he believes one can justify throwing the world into chaos for a time, if it is done in service of bringing peace to the people of the world.

“However if you misuse it you will undoubtedly receive divine punishment.” True to the immortal’s warning, the Yellow Turbans who followed Zhang Jue’s teachings and caused trouble across China may well have ended up dying miserably before their goals had been realized. Zhang Jue, however, refuses to accept that fact. He believes he is fully in the right, and that there is no such thing as divine punishment for doing the right thing. According to him, any Yellow Turbans of his who happened to die from disease were simply unlucky, nothing more. A troublesome old man who is not only willing to use questionable means, but refuses to reflect or repent if he believes his ends are justified.
