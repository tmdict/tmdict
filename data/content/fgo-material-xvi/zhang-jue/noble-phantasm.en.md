The Azure Sky Dead, The Yellow Sky Rises.
A Noble Phantasm that takes its name from the slogan which became the Yellow Turbans’ rallying cry. It is nothing less than the embodiment of the turbulent times that drove people to take up arms against the empire oppressing them. Simply put, Zhang Jue uses the weather manipulation arts wielded by him and his brothers to summon storms, thunder, hail, fog, and other natural phenomena that can be used for large-scale military offensives. This Noble Phantasm also allows control of puppets under Yellow Turban manipulation arts and peasants allied with their cause, by combining these two effects it’s possible to fight even the government’s army.
