I thought I’d show off my strengths as a mangaka by drawing lots of different facial expressions. Just as I was thinking “This much is alright, right?” Mélusine was released having a whole lot of different facial expressions and so I thought “Ahhhhhh, if I don’t draw even more I’ll be overshadowed” and added even more faces. I’m sorry for the trouble I caused. This is also the first time a character I drew gets a voice, so I was incredibly moved. And I never expected to get such an amazing performance for the final ascension, so I actually cried a little. The lines and the voice were absolutely perfect.” (Takeshi Kawaguchi)
