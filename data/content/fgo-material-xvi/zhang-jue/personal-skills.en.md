### General of Heaven: B-

A skill coming from the title he adopted as the supreme leader of the Yellow Turban Rebellion. He also gave his younger brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang the titles of "General of Earth" and "General of the People" respectively. This skill represents the strength of his leadership and authority as the one who led hundreds of thousands of Yellow Turbans into battle. Similar to Charisma, this skill’s benefits are best demonstrated in its user’s military capabilities. Its rank is a little on the low side since Zhang Jue fell to disease before he could finish his fight, and because his Yellow Turbans’ rebellion got off to a slow start thanks to them being betrayed by former comrades.

### Great Teacher: A

A skill that shows him as the founder of The Way of Peace, gaining followers and using fúshuǐ to cure plagues. A composite skill combining his talents for folk medicine, his techniques for winning over people as a religious leader, his eloquence and his evangelistic abilities. As all of these skills are interpersonal rather than military it’s of higher rank than his first skill.

### Taipingjing: EX

In the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it’s said that Zhang Jue received a book by this name from an old immortal coming from the southern lands. From this book Zhang Jue learned weather manipulation and various other arts. As he received it he was told “Make use of this to make the world a better place. However if you misuse it you will undoubtedly receive divine punishment”.
