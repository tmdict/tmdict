### Personality

Don Quixote is not particularly inclined to listen to what people have to say, but he is unfailingly polite to women, kind to the weak, and bold to the strong. This compassionate, earnest personality remains the same as ever, making him well-suited for knighthood.

Meanwhile, his faithful companion, Sancho, is as capable as maids come, doing everything in her power to grant her sir’s wishes without losing her smile. That being said she is skilled in how to handle him.

Although Don Quixote has sworn loyalty to his Master, and will conduct himself in a manner befitting a knight, Sancho’s loyalties lie exclusively with Don Quixote.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

In his First and Second Ascensions he comes off as a confident knight, but when he reaches his Third Ascension he becomes the complete opposite; an old man lacking in self-confidence, a heartbreaking scene to watch.

### Dialogue Examples

“Oh, my name is Don Quixote de la Mancha! I am a knight errant traveling the world seeking the love of a princess! Behold my magnificent figure in all its glory!” (Don Quixote) 
“Come, come, Rocinante! My charge is fast as a flash!” (Don Quixote) 
“You can do it! Go, go, go! Sir knight~” (Sancho) 
“What more do you want from a shabby old man like me? You have nothing left to want” (Don Quixote) 
“Sir knight, that is not true. What they want is your courage above all else.” (Sancho) 

### Historical Image · Character Image

Penned by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes in the 17th century, “Don Quixote” is said to have sold more copies than any other novel in the world. In 2002, a group of writers from all across the world named it as the greatest work of fiction ever written. Its influence can be felt in countless works of art and music throughout history, and the name of its titular character has become widely understood shorthand for people with big, delusional dreams.

In the original book, Don Quixote is a poor fifty-year-old farmer who becomes so enamored with the idea of knighthood that he sells off the very land on which he’s made his living for so long. In his madness, he truly believes he is the knight-errant he claims to be, which prompts him to set off on an adventure with his emaciated old horse, Rocinante, and his attendant, Sancho.

Over the course of his adventure, he famously charges at a windmill he mistakes for a giant and finds himself chased off a farmer’s land after treating the farmer’s daughters as royalty. Later, a scholar and friend of his, Samson Carrasco, pretends to be a knight himself in hopes of bringing Don Quixote back to reality, only to have Don Quixote challenge him to a duel and win. But then, after Carrasco’s wounds are healed, he comes back to his friend posing as a different knight and this time wins their duel. For the next year, Carrasco then brings Don Quixote back to their hometown so he may live a peaceful life.

As Carrasco predicted, Don Quixote reluctantly returns to their village. Unfortunately, the illness that cures him of his madness also gives him a fever that brings him to the brink of death. After suffering for six days, Don Quixote regains his original identity as Alonso Quixano, curses his attempt at knighthood as foolish nonsense, and dies without ever losing his most precious knightly possession: his innate humane goodness.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

His First and Second Ascensions present him as the kind of ideal knight he always dreamed of becoming: proud, dignified, and with his beloved princess by his side.

His Third Ascension, on the other hand, shows him for what he really is: a frail-looking old man who understands reality, yet still strives to be the knight he’s so long aspired to become. But, unlike reality, Servants really do live in a world of dreams. And so, with Sancho prodding him along, he continues to summon up the courage in his old bones to face the giant we call “reality.”

### Regarding Sancho Panza

In a sense she is more like a Phantom Spirit, but in the story of Don Quixote she takes on the role of attendant, princess and reality itself, in a sense she can be said to be an antithesis to Don Quixote, the background characters of the story and the author, all made manifest.

When she follows him as an attendant she acts like a country farmer, other times she gives advice as the noble Princess Dulcinea other times, at others she expresses romantic feelings for him as the Duchess’ attendant Altisidora (or rather she pretends, just like a certain Duchess ordered her attendant to do so).

At the root of all of this is “Reality” Don Quixote’s greatest enemy. However when Don Quixote’s story ends and she sees him return to reality she feels a sense of regret.

### In Traum

At first, Don Quixote claimed to have been summoned to the large-scale Singularity, Traum, as one of the few Servants on the side of Proper Human History, but in fact, he was actually first summoned to the Lostbelt in Atlantis. Though he initially did his best to make his way through Atlantis and reach Olympus alongside other heroic Servants, seeing Heracles vaporized robbed him of his will to fight. Sancho, seeing her sir terrified for his life, decided to use her Noble Phantasm to escape from Atlantis, only for them both to wind up in the Traum Singularity.

Upon seeing the vast army of Servants revolting against humanity, Sancho then came up with a plan for them to survive by pretending to be Charles the Great and establishing the Righteous Realm. They then attempted to secretly gather like-minded Servants on Proper Human History’s side and fight back against the other two realms. But, circumstances being what they were, gathering other Servants proved difficult, and it was clear that their current disadvantageous position was untenable. It was then that they found new allies in the Master of Chaldea and the Servants accompanying them, which helped them to renew their efforts to fight back against the Revenge and Reinstatement Realms.

Incidentally, Don Quixote tried several times to apologize to the Master of Chaldea, but never found the time or the words, right up until he disappeared. Although Sancho believed, correctly, that there was nothing more they could have done on their own no matter how hard they tried, he still couldn’t help but feel guilty for his actions, which contradicted the oaths of knighthood he swore. In the end, though, Don Quixote the Servant died in Traum as he lived: fighting side by side with Sancho, and holding always to his innate human goodness.

### Connections with Characters

#### The Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne

These knights were, in a sense, the catalyst for Alonso Quixano’s fall into chivalry (The legend of Roland and his companions were very well known at the time and their names appear numerous times in the story so it’s highly likely that their legends were the basis for his fantasies). They too are dream like beings and he can’t help but feel conflicted as they make him feel like his dreams will always be dreams

#### Other Knight Servants

In his First and Second ascensions, he is generally well-received by most of the knights, perhaps because he always greets them with a fearless and dignified attitude when they meet.

Every time he meets a knight, he gets scared and struggles to contain the shock of his jealousy and agony.

The more the knight embodies the ideals of chivalry, the more pronounced this reaction becomes.

#### Mordred

Maybe because he is a traitorous rebel who has strayed from the path of chivalry he gets along well with Third Ascension Don Quixote.

#### Marie Antoinette

The ideal form of a princess.

So ideal, in fact, that Don Quixote suddenly finds himself wondering if she might actually be Princess Dulcinea—only for Sancho to step on his foot in response.
