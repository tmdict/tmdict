### Seasoned Knight’s Grand Adventure: EX

The Grand Adventures of Don Quixote.

Sancho recounts Don Quixote’s grand adventures wherein he traveled far and wide spreading goodness and justice wherever he landed and proclaiming the beauty of his beloved Princess Dulcinea to the world.

### Open Door of Dreams: EX

Opening this door transforms Don Quixote into his ideal knight, while closing it returns him to reality, thereby blurring the line between fantasy and reality. While technically a variant of Madness Enhancement, it does not make him go berserk. Instead, it simply makes him a braver knight. Unfortunately, this does also make him somewhat reckless… Reckless enough to, say…charge at a windmill.

### Closed Book of Reality: E

A return to reality. Needless to say, this also means returning to being a powerless old man, forcing him to give up his dreams. But even so, in this reality, he still has to fight.
