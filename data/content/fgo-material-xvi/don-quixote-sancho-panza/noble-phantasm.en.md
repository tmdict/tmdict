### Valiente Asalto Dedicado a la Princesa: I Dedicate This Spear to My Beloved Princess!

This Noble Phantasm reproduces the most famous anecdote regarding Don Quixote: his charge against a windmill he mistook for a giant. Even if he is in his Third Ascension, he temporarily reverts to his First Ascension until this Noble Phantasm is complete. Conversely, if he’s already in his First Ascension, he will temporarily transform into his Third as a sign of how winded he is.

As the original story ended in the windmill knocking him away, this Noble Phantasm is certainly not without its drawbacks. However, the important part of the story is that he charged at what he believed to be a fearsome giant, knowing as he did so that he was terribly outmatched. For the purposes of this Noble Phantasm, this translates to both damaging those nearby and providing them with powerful buffs.

Incidentally, when he charges, you can see Sancho cheer him on by waving a flag.

### Triste Gentil Alonso Quixano: I Offer You Kind, Miserable Reality

Sancho Panza’s Noble Phantasm that returns the world to the way it was, replacing any and all nearby fantasies with the reality of seventeenth-century Spain. No matter what manner of Mystics the affected target may possess, they will be diluted down to the level of real 17th century Spanish society. (Against Age of Gods level Mystics the effect is weakened). Greatly weakens Don Quixote along with the target. (Fundamentally not used in FateGO)
