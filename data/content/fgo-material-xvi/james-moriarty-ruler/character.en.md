### Personality

An agreeable and eloquent young man. He’s quite sociable despite his scary eyes, an issue that he’s working around to solve. He loves mathematics and always spends his time counting and calculating. He’s on his way to astound the world with his math, or maybe following the path of education. Who knows? Either way, his future is promising.

He approached himself with a choice. “Will I abandon glory? Will I turn evil? You didn’t even need to ask. The answer was decided ages ago. I’ll be the ruler and arbiter of evil.”

### Attitude towards Master

He initially faces others as a cheerful and likable young man, but when they know about his future as a schemer grandpa, he turns considerably sloppy and impolite.

He takes the role of a toxic friend from college with suspicious connections or a high school classmate lending his notebook while ruthlessly criticizing you.

### General Armaments

Fights using a trick cane and a combat-optimized super-ruler (the Logarithm Accel-Loader). Also, his Conspiracy Creation Skill lets him install improvised traps. His proudest trick is the flour explosion.

### Dialogue Examples

#### Ascension 1

Pleased to make your acquaintance, if that’s the first time for you too. My name is James Moriarty. Random question, but have you ever met my older self? You have? …Then I have nothing to hide. Sorry in advance for anything that may happen, as you can see I’m your regular youth. I am certainly lacking experience, but I hope to compensate for it with my youthful vigor.

#### Ascension 2-3

And the butterfly became the Napoleon. Kneel before me, evildoer. I’m James Moriarty, Napoleon of Crime. This is the moment when I saw my complete form. All thanks to you, Master.

### Historical Image

There are no historical records of any math professor or student named James Moriarty. However, there’s nothing proving that “James Moriarty” has always been the name he went by.

### Character Image in “FateGO”

The boss of a devilish organization with strings stretched all over Europe. He is so cautious that almost no one, not even within his organization, knows who he is.

This Moriarty is summoned from before that, when he was a young man with a promising future filled with hope. But he had already made the most important choice of his life, so all he had left to do was ruthlessly and relentlessly brave the path of evil.

Nonetheless… He was a mildly better person during his younger days and had something of a fragile self-esteem. He gave off the impression of a very pleasant young man, especially without his makeup.

### In Traum

He’s the final boss, but not the main culprit. He contacted Servants such as Kriemhild, Constantine XI, and Pope Johanna, and requested them to fight a war between Realms.

Moriarty had multiple goals in the Singularity, which complicates his situation. (Moriarty loved the complication)

Step one: arrange a substructure to whittle down Sherlock Holmes. Step two: make the Singularity more chaotic and tumultuous to prevent the alien god from suspecting him. Step 3: drive Chaldea to a corner and approach them as their new savior.

He acquired the Norns as the components he needed for these goals. Urd, Verthandi, and Skuld. Through their power to measure and weave the strings, he neutralized all attacks by establishing he wasn’t fated to get hurt and removed all obstacles by establishing he was fated to overcome them.

…But, as Mash pointed out, this power has a weakness: it will inevitably weaken after he overcame a dramatic fate. The protagonist can’t remain the protagonist for much longer after defeating his arch-enemy.

Holmes challenged him to a one-on-one battle to increase the dramatics of his fate. You could say Holmes’s defeat led to a victory down the line.

In the end, he presented the most amazing riddle before his Saint Graph fully terminated.

### Connections with Characters

#### Sherlock Holmes

A person with so much purpose in his eyes that at their first eye contact, Moriarty determined himself to ruin Holmes before Holmes ruined him.

“I have to hand it to my 50-year-old self, it’s impressive that he managed to battle a guy like this!”

#### Moriarty (Old)

The first thing he was relieved about upon seeing himself aged 50 wasn’t his lucid brain or his evil looks.

“I DIDN’T GET FAT, HELL YEAH!”

It was that his figure remaining roughly the same. But he failed to predict the chronic back pain problems.

He’s a literature guy and I’m a science guy, so we were supposed to be as incompatible as it would get, but… Well, hmm, the unexpected sometimes may happen!
