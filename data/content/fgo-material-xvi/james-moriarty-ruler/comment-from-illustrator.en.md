Our guy Mori the Young had the most overblown animation costs and I’m to blame for filling up the page with details to my tastes. I hadn’t done a male Servant in forever, so I let the excitement get the better of me. His suit has an old-school military design full of gold strips and gold tinsels. His cane is modeled after dividers, anemometers, and vacuum tubes; made of brass, and choke full of ridged accessories. In his first stage, he carries an item with the measuring capabilities of a T-ruler under his arms. His floating chair is meant to resemble a pipe organ. Every little part of Mori the Young had a lot of thought put into it. (Honjou Raita)
