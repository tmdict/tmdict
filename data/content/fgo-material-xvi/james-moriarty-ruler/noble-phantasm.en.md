### Mathematical Malignant Annihilate: Mathematical Malevolence Extraction

<table>
  <tr><td>Rank</td><td>B++</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Type</td><td>Anti-Unit Noble Phantasm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Range</td><td>1~10</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Maximum Number of Targets</td><td>Up to the number of evildoers present</td></tr>

MMA, for short. Not to be confused with Mixed Martial Arts. It extracts and steals the malevolence of all targets on the field. Every creature has malevolence, except mechanical lifeforms and those who attained sainthood. Extracting them works towards effectively depowering targets. That’s because this malevolence includes feelings necessary for combat, such as fighting spirit, hostility, and bloodlust. If you lack those in battle, you’re doomed to fall behind.

The yet-to-be-completed formula for planetary collapse. It could be used as a Noble Phantasm to cause major destruction… but Young Moriarty keeps this Noble Phantasm sealed to best of his ability. That’s because his equation is still incomplete, and as such, it’s a thesis not ready to be defended as a Noble Phantasm. The professor gets startled when he receives a question from someone in the defense board. Wait, who is the defense board for Noble Phantasms?
