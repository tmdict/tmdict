Nansou Satomi Hakkenden.
The goddess Fusehime under the protection of the gods and the Buddha striding across the sky on Yatsufusa’s back. Fusehime’s unwavering devotion to justice, a constant throughout the Eight Dog Chronicles, transforms into a spiritual blade, which she then uses in conjunction with her indomitable will to lay waste to all enemies in her path.
