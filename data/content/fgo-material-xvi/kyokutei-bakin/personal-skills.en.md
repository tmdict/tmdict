### Svabhāva: B

A Buddhist phrase that means “the name makes the person.” Here, it refers to the unique naming system Bakin used in many of his books. For example, the “fuse” in “Fusehime” has a deeper meaning of “a human who obeys a dog.” Naming is both a prayer for creation, and a curse of righteousness. In the magecraft world, understanding a being’s true name is essential to controlling it.

### Eight Benevolences and Righteousnesses: A

Benevolence. Justice. Courtesy. Wisdom. Loyalty. Faith. Piety. Respect.

Eight virtues considered essential for a human.

The spirit beads that symbolize these virtues, each of which has the character for that virtue printed on it, flew off in eight directions after Fusehime died, and came to be possessed by each of the eight Dog Warriors from the day they were born. Eventually, once the Dog Warriors all came together, these mysterious beads then bestowed new power upon the goddess Fusehime.

### Lost in Writing: A

A skill that reflects the countless busy days Kyokutei Bakin spent absorbed in the act of creation. Symbolizes the bond between Bakin and his daughter-in-law, Omichi, who supported him after he lost his sight.
