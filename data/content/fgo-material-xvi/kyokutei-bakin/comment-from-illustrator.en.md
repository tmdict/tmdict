Since Kyokutei Bakin is one Servant with three completely distinct personalities, I figured that if they were all different people, their expressions would also be completely different. So, I prepared three sets of facial expressions for all three personalities, but making adjustments and managing everything during the process was the most challenging part.

Regarding the Eight Dog Warriors, I was told that the breed of the dogs didnâ€™t need to be limited to Japanese breeds, so I primarily chose breeds that are easy to distinguish even as puppies and seemed like they could hold their own in a fight to some extent. That said, the illustrations prioritize cuteness and a sense of softness, with an intentional two-dimensional (flat) aesthetic (TAKOLEGS)
