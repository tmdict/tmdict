Jacques de Molay (Saber) is a Servant that represented the financial organization (bank) of the Knights Templar so I created a design based on the black arm covers worn by bankers in the past. The pouch was also made to look like a wallet, and bar codes, which are associated with money, were also incorporated into the costume. The sheep character was also designed to resemble mascots, often seen in banks. The wrists, ankles, and neck are drawn one size thinner than usual because he tends to get sick. For Molay (foreigner), the sheep has been changed to a goat, and the back of the shield has been made to look like a Genghis Khan pot. (Kouhaku Kuroboshi)
