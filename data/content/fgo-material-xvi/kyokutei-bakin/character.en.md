### Personality

Bold, Proud and Meticulous.

He values duty and morals, but he also adheres to strict discipline. He is not a free-spirited artist, but has the professionalism one would expect from Japan’s first full-time writer. He lives a well ordered life, properly adhering to the same schedule every day while making time to write. Even when something that interests him happens he does not go against his schedule.

As a Rider Bakin does not pursue the act of writing above all else. Writing was a way for him to make a living while also gaining fame as a way to revive the Takizawa samurai house. While he never took on an apprentice and lived a solitary life he kept close friendships with other writers and was well aware of the joys and dangers of writing. Though he was born into a samurai family, he suffered poverty and was often struck by misfortune, such as his eldest son, who he had high hopes for, dying young. Through his experiences studying under his master, Santo Kyoden, a merchant of lower status than himself, and the publisher Tsutaya Juzaburo, he developed a sense of balance in line with times, possessing the values of both a commoner and a warrior.

### Motivation · Attitude towards Master

Like a samurai serving their lord he tries to understand Masters’ intentions and faithfully carry them out. On the other hand he can be a bit fussy about things and has a habit of wanting to be in charge.

### Historical Image · Character Image

A writer from late Edo Japan, and one of Japan’s best-known authors. His works include Nansou Satomi Hakkenden and Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki. He also wrote Keisei Suikoden, Kinsesetsu Bishonenroku, and many more. Many of his works including the hugely popular, at the time, Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki were illustrated by ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai.

Born to a samurai family—a source of constant pride for Bakin—his innate talent for the written word ultimately led to him becoming the first Japanese person to make a living solely from writing.

His real name is Takizawa Okikuni. Kyokutei Bakin is his pen name, though he also went by the pseudonym Chosadoushujin. He is extremely well-versed in the history and traditions of various eras and regions, and particularly enjoys reading Chinese novels such as “The Water Margin,” and even knows a fair amount of medicine and Confucian philosophy.

Born in Edo Fukagawa as the fifth son of a hatamoto younin (chief retainer). Before he became a writer, he worked many different jobs, including page to the Matsudaira clan, retainer to a hatamoto, head clerk at the Tsuruya publishing house, footwear merchant, and apprentice to a calligraphy master.

He decided to become a full time writer at age 24. At 36, he took a trip to the Kyoto-Osaka area where he met well-known literary figures, which inspired him to begin publishing his work with greater frequency. In time, his novel “Sanshichi Zenden Nanka no Yume” and his epic “Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki” became highly popular, establishing him as one of the leading authors of his time.

During this period, Kyokutei Bakin also became close friends with the ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai, even letting him stay at his house for three or four months when Bakin was 39, Hokusai 46, and Hokusai’s daughter, Oei, 6. Said to be over 180cm each, both Bakin and Hokusai were exceptionally tall, especially for the time and place, which made them quite the sight on the streets of Edo.

Tokimura Michi

Kyokutei Bakin’s daughter-in-law after she married into the Takizawa family. Born into a doctor’s family in Edo Kanda, she is a true Edo town girl and also a skilled dancer. As part of her bridal training, she worked as a maidservant for the Matsudaira clan and for the Ooku in Edo Castle.

In Bakin’s later years, after he lost his sight, she enabled him to continue his career by serving as both his eyes and brush, writing down his words as he dictated them to her. She was instrumental to the completion of the “Nansou Satomi Eight Dog Chronicles,” a lengthy epic that took 28 years in total to finish. Michi had to learn how to read and write many difficult characters and words of Chinese origin as part of her duties, and she struggled at times to meet Bakin’s exacting standards, but she persevered and ultimately succeeded brilliantly.

Even now as a Servant, she gives Kyokutei Bakin her sight and as such serves as the basis of his physical appearance.

Fusehime

A character from Nansou Satomi Hakkenden. The eldest daughter of Satomi Yoshizane, the founder of the Awa Satomi clan and descendant of Nitta Genji. One day, her father jokingly says to Fusehime’s pet dog, Yatsufusa, that he would offer Yatsufusa Fusehime’s hand in marriage if only Yatsufusa would bring him back the head of a vexing enemy general. To their surprise, Yatsufusa did exactly that the very next day, prompting Fusehime to volunteer to hide away in a cave on Mt. To along with Yatsufusa in order to keep her father’s promise. Over time due to exposure to Yatsufusa’s spiritual energy her stomach began to swell, causing her father to suspect her of getting pregnant by Yatsufusa and, to prove her innocence to her father, she commits suicide.

Upon her death, Buddhist prayer beads wreathed in spiritual energy,flew out in eight directions coming to reside in the bodies of eight dog warriors with ties to the Satomi clan. From then on, Fusehime became a goddess protecting the Satomi clan from the shadows.

She uses the first person pronoun Wanami.

A proud, daring, and righteous woman who refuses to tolerate any wrongdoing, her physical age serves as the base for Kyokutei Bakin’s Servant form.

Yatsufusa

Another character from Nansou Satomi Hakkenden.

An exceptionally large dog who was raised by tanuki, he adores Fusehime with all his heart. Mistakenly taking Satomi Yoshizane’s jest about marrying his daughter as having been made in earnest, he hurried off to bring back an enemy general’s head and ultimately returned victorious.

Although the lingering grudge of former enemies dwelled within his body, he was able to overcome it thanks to Fusehime’s sutra readings. Though he unfortunately died of a wound from a stray bullet, in death he stayed together with Fusehime becoming a spirit dog divine messenger.

Eight Dog Warriors

These puppy familiars who make up the eight Dog Warriors symbolize Bakin’s unconventional creative process, with very high highs and very low lows.

[Benevolence] Shinbei (corresponding to Inue Shinbei). Has a birthmark on his side. The youngest, often plays pranks with Dousetsu.

[Justice] Sousuke (Inukawa Sousuke). Has a birthmark on his back. A worldly dog who tends to miss out on many things because of his cautious, reserved nature.

[Courtesy] Daikaku (Inumura Daikaku). Has a birthmark on the left side of his chest. The goodest of good boys. Perhaps worryingly so.

[Wisdom] Keno (Inuzuka Keno). Has a birthmark going from his right elbow to upper arm. A beautiful dog who often fights with Shino.

[Loyalty] Dousetsu (Inuyama Dousetsu). Has a birthmark on his left shoulder. A noisy pup with a notoriously short fuse.

[Faith] Genpachi (Inukai Genpachi). Has a birthmark on the tip of his right cheek. One of the younger dogs who nonetheless possesses great strength.

[Piety] Shino (Inuzuka Shino). Has a peony-shaped birthmark on his left arm. A majestic dog. To cut a long story short, he is shameless and fat.

[Respect] Kobungo (Inuta Kobungo). Has a birthmark on his butt. A glutton who really should learn moderation.

### General Armaments

#### Ascension 1 and 2

Skillfully uses the iron fan, short sword and rifle. He also shows the agile movements of jujutsu. The Eight Dog Warriors come to help depending on their mood. Compared to Bakin’s seriousness the Eight Dog Warriors humorously show no sense of urgency as if what’s going on has nothing to do with them. Skill animations include things like taking out a brush to write in a diary and taking care of the Eight Dog Warriors.

#### Ascension 3

She will lay waste to all while riding on Yatsufusa. Or Fusehime will use the Xian Arts associated with each of the Eight Dog Warriors without needing their assistance while displaying her sword skills.

Attacks and heals using the treasured sword Murasamemaru, fire release techniques and the power of the eight beads.

### Connections with Characters

#### Katsushika Hokusai

Is my relationship with Tetsuzo…. Or rather “Katsushika Hokusai” an inseparable bond or a deeply cursed connection!? That man if I say right he says left, if I call it a tiger he says it’s a dragon. If I call out “whirlpool” he says it’s a big wave. If you were to gather all the parts missing from me and mold them together, you’d end up with that man. The fact that Hokusai and I were able to publish Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki together probably made us the strangest duo in Edo at the time. And now, to think that we’re working side by side here in Chaldea… My, my…

#### Katsushika Oui (Swimsuit)

Ei…. You’re Oei aren’t you? Ah yes, you’ve always been a bit of a precocious girl. Ho, hold on now I’ve already started working on my next book. Even if you have stars in your eyes you can’t expect me to be done just like that. Look I know it’s not my place to ask……. But since I met you here I’ll ask anyway. That okay? Did Katsushika Oui become a good ukiyo-e artist?

Is that so?… Well then that’s alright. ……Eh, you’re a fairy?

Chinzei Hachirou Tametomo (Minamoto-no-Tametomo)
Chinzei Hachirou Minamoto-no-Tametomo dono.

Certainly I was extremely surprised by the delicate and sophisticated “machinery”. Truly, truly, you are a brave warrior, exceeding my wildest expectations! Maybe it’s the fate of a writer, but I can’t help but feel something akin to parental affection….?

No matter, I want to write the story of your adventures such that Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki will pale in comparison.

#### Okada Izo

This swordsman, who appears unassuming and makes an uncomfortable face whenever I call Hokusai ’Tetsuzou!’ To think that, in his youth, he survived the fierce battlefields of the late Bakumatsu period, only to meet such an untimely end… Truly, reality is stranger than fiction. His loyalty is worthy of admiration. Perfectly carrying out orders and returning back with the enemy’s head, he reminded me somewhat of Yatsufusa……. or so I thought but I think that was a mistake on my part.

I don’t have any more money! I’m telling you, I don’t!

#### Pretty Boys

Ah…, they’re great aren’t they? All the pretty boys. Pretty boys with a thing for crossdressing. Pretty boys stained with path of evil. This is all so fascinating. Ah, but at the end of the day this is just like the story inside of novel, right? Thanks to you, Michi is having the time of my life as I spend these wonderful, brilliant days at Chaldea (Michi)

#### Wielders of Famous Swords

Famous swords from around the whole world gathered in one place…… Yes, what fine swords….

It would most definitely cause a disturbance but I absolutely want to have a battle here… I’ve been secretly hoping that the lord here would organize a swordsmanship tournament. (Fusehime){{n1}}

##### {{notes}}

1. {{note1}} Okay so this one is a bit weird. In the JP what Fusehime says she’s been secretly hoping for is a 御前試合 or a match attended by a Lord. After some researching I found out that a 御前試合 can either be a contest a Lord organizes or a contest that a Lord is invited to. Given the way the sentence is I decided to translate it as her hoping Guda would organize a contest.
