#### — Concerning the suppression of Arcueid’s power.

The True Ancestors are the Touch of Earth—something like its immune system.
True Ancestors of the highest grade like Arcueid are one step above that of an immune system—something which would no doubt be appropriate to label as the Alter-Ego of Earth.
(In fact, the True Ancestors were only ever birthed to create a frame on the level of an Alter-Ego of Earth. All True Ancestors outside of Arc were failures. Yet in the True Ancestors’ last days, they succeeded in creating the Brain of the Planet that had been desired in the first place).
However, that such a lifeform would conduct itself in a human body could in itself actually be said to be something abnormal.
If you pack the energy of a celestial object into a tiny human body, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that it would suddenly go out of control.

As long as Arcueid remains active, her output is limited to always be one step above her opponent, but this is not a representation of her sheer power.
This is to protect the body in its function as an output device, and to prevent wasting energy (for the earth).
However, in the case that the limiter of the body is taken away from her, and Arcueid’s mental activity is unabated, the suppression of her power is undone.
The magical energy hidden within her body disperses almost in an explosion, and the limit on her ability to draw energy from the Earth is removed.
This is Inflation—the Inflationary Luminary Phenomenon.

Though normally bound to the planet’s interior, being a ‘soul’ (the chances of a celestial object being born in space is practically none. Force of Fate and Spacetime Causality which lets this be established is defined as a soul) meant for prolonged utilization (administration) of its celestial object, once it leaks onto the surface, it causes a system critical error.

That said, True Ancestors almost never enter this state.
The usual True Ancestor’s mind is worn down by having to suppress themselves, so when their body is destroyed, they do not have the mental strength (as it is abated) to recover
Luminaries have manifested in battles with ‘fallen True Ancestors’—those who have succumbed to their own vampiric urges—but in those cases the Luminaries did not emerge on as large a scale as Arcueid did.
“If thou wisheth to exterminate a True Ancestor, thou shalt first wear down its mind”
This is a teaching passed down among the Church. Just as this precept suggests, Executors do not assassinate True Ancestors from the shadows, but instead defeat them in prolonged all-out wars from head-on—or alternatively—push them into self-termination from a lack of magical energy (because if you kill them via a sneak attack, there’s a high chance they’ll turn into a Luminary).

#### — Concerning the actions of Luminary Arc

Her gigantic size alone makes her powerful, but her actions are not all that showy.
The same goes for when she caught Ciel:

1. She slowly reaches out for the astonished Ciel.
  Ciel, feeling she is in a pinch, tries to move back, but her body is heavy.
2. Though Ciel would normally be capable of easily dodging Arc’s hand, she only barely manages.
  She pushes her body to try to keep going and create some distance, but it doesn’t obey.
3. Ciel then notices that just being inside of Arc’s zone of influence causes a litany of debuffs such as…
  The thinning of the air, the heating of the ground, and what’s more, gravity being kind of weird.
4. However, even having noticed this, it’s far too late.
  Arc enjoys watching Ciel pathetically squirm as she tries to escape.
  At this point, Ciel is practically done for—sewn into space from being looked at by Arc.
5. Ciel can do nothing but watch with despair on her face as Arcueid slowly lowers her hand onto her.
  Once caught, the spectacle of her dismemberment inside of Arc’s hand begins.

#### — The dangers brought on by the three zones of influence

Arc has three layers of consciousness in her Luminary model.

#### 3: AMAZING—Extended Consciousness that goes beyond the Surface Consciousness into the outer world.

(AMAZING—with the meaning of ‘awe’—the fascination of the unknown born from amazement and wonder)
It starts from 300 meters outside the Luminary and extends for several kilometers.
Air turbulence originating from the inside of the Surface Consciousness (2) is let loose (spills out) onto the Extended Consciousness, almost like sharp blades.
The turmoil of the harsh winds, magnetic fields and more, mean that the closer one gets to Arcueid, the more dangerous it becomes. It is impossible for a human to enter the zone of influence of her Surface Consciousness (2) unless they’re in a tank.
Though this is already a dangerous state, physically speaking, the more one distances oneself from the Luminary, the less the danger becomes.
Luminary Arc is completely unaware of the lifeforms inside this Extended Consciousness.
Humans who challenge it are like Don Quixote, voluntarily challenging a dragon—voluntarily going off to die.
Here, the Luminary can be seen as a dome of light—or alternatively, as some kind of symbol.

#### 2: AUDIENCE—Surface Consciousness that extends radially for 300 meters diagonally with the Luminary at its center.

(AUDIENCE—not with the meaning of ‘spectators’ or ‘onlookers’, but that of ‘being granted audience’)
Within the 300 meters of the Surface Consciousness, afforestation proceeds far more dramatically.
The Luminary goes from looking like ‘some light thing’ to a human-shaped titan.
The vegetation that covers the ground’s surface are the same primordial plants as known to mankind, but their size and resilience make them almost completely different—basically, they’re huge, almost 10 to 20 times larger than usual.
These clearly display just how tough the vegetation of the Earth was in the past.
No matter how weak and adapted to the current environment of life that nature of modernity may be, it doesn’t change how frightening this primeval (paleozoic) vegetation once was (before the Mesozoic and the Jurassic periods when the dinosaurs lived, there weren’t any plants that could bear flowers, so be careful to not add that).
It gives off the intimidating impression that primeval nature was far more powerful than human civilization is.
Within this zone of influence, the ground is covered in primeval vegetation, making travel by foot almost entirely impossible (though this does not apply to people who are superhuman).
The difference in atmospheric pressure between the ground and the sky (temperature gradients caused by the oxygen consumption of the gigantic vegetation) perturbs the airflow, creating a corridor of harsh wind from the intersection of up- and downdrafts.
Obstructed by the plants, it becomes impossible to move on land, while the air turbulence in the sky makes it impossible to fly particularly well.
And yet, under these kinds of conditions, the automatic counter-attacks performed by the standard rampaging Arc are carried out as well.
This is because once an enemy has entered the Surface Consciousness, they are obviously recognized as such—as an enemy.
If they then by some stroke of bad luck enter Arc’s view, they will be restrained by her Mystic Eyes, at which point they’re doomed.
The automatic counter-attacks become like invisible claws, either cutting the enemy into pieces, or blowing them up into the air like a leaf, toying with them until they die.
Thinking that it’s impossible to survive in the sky, one stops on the ground, only to find there is no oxygen left (the gigantic vegetation is sucking all of it up).
As should be evident from all this, the Surface Consciousness is not an environment in which the current mankind could exist.
Luminary Arc takes not a single action, settling the matter simply by recognizing those who enter as her enemy—almost as if they were fruit flies, flying toward their own death.

#### 1: SKINRAIL—Deep Unconsciousness that exists close (within 30 meters) to herself

(SKIN—with the meaning of the skin also being a railing, even if it’s close enough of a distance to touch with others)
In this zone of influence, the visual impairments coming from the turbulent airflow, the distortions of the Luminary’s energy, and so on, disappear, and the Luminary can be seen for real.
Unlike the revolving airflow hell that was the Surface Consciousness, here the atmosphere is stable, with the environment suited for life.
Once something enters this zone of influence, Luminary Arc will—though hesitantly—counter-attack.
Just by pointing her gaze towards them, she can invoke heat waves and gales that blow them away with an impact that’s almost like a hammer.
Luminary Arc herself almost never does things like punch or stomp though.
If they then stop moving after running out of energy, she’ll probably leave them be…
But if they happen to be an enemy she has an interest in, she’ll probably use her Atmospheric Manipulation to bring them up (into the air) before her eyes.
She went to the effort of stretching out her arms so ostentatiously in trying to terrify Ciel because—yes—Ciel was special.
As for Shiki, she stubbornly refused to ever touch him on her own, due to him having touched her—this pretend indifference is thought to have been a snide way for her to get back at him.

And now for some FAQs about the Luminary.

#### — Can you touch it?

Once it enters a stable state, the Luminary materializes—so yes, it has hit detection.
It feels both like hard stone and flowing water to the touch.
Also, Arc can will parts of it to rarefy, and when she does that, she can pass those through buildings and what-not.
— Since it’s light, does that mean it’s hot?
It’s a bit hot, but not enough to get burned.

#### — How much reason is left in Luminary Arc?

Enough. She doesn’t feel like saying very much, but that doesn’t mean her reason is lost. It’s more that her True Ancestor supernaturality has gotten stronger.
She does talk, but not with her voice, instead sending orders directly to the other party’s brain (telepathy), meaning that her lips don’t move when she speaks.

#### — What does she look like to humans?

Depends on the situation and how far away they are.

First, when she’s emerging: it’s totally fine if she’s super scary here. I think something to the effect of the demonic terror found in the storyboard is fine.

Then, when she’s stabilized—around the time when she’s caught Ciel and is playing around with her:
When someone is distantly removed from the Luminary—300 meters or more outside her zone of influence—she only looks like light, while if they’re within the 300 meters of her zone of influence, she has a human shape. I think it’d be fine if one could see that there are eye-shaped holes (kind of like cavities) where her mouth, eyes, etc, are supposed to be.

When even closer to the Luminary—30 meters within Arc’s zone of influence—then the light being emitted looks more subdued, with her eyes and mouth (lips) shining with the brilliance of life. In fact, make her look even more beautiful than normal Arcueid.
This is like a perception manipulation effect that the Luminary has against intelligent beings.
Those who look on from afar will get the impression of something terrifyingly unknowable.
While those who have arrived close will get the impression of something beautifully unknowable.
Those who are far away are enemies who are to be killed without being shown the truth.
While those who are close by are allies who are to be given a glimpse of the truth—a truly spiritually divine (religiously speaking) mechanism.
