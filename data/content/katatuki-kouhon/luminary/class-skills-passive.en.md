### Luminary: A

Rapid expansion (Inflation) of the Spiritron Core.
A phenomenon more simply called a ‘Luminary’.
(‘Inflation’ is originally terminology from astronomy—it’s what the exponential expansion of the universe that occured after the Big Bang is called) A state of excitation possessed by True Ancestors of the highest grade—their royalty. It’s said to occur as a side-effect when the True Ancestor has by some means had its body completely destroyed.
When Arcueid—a small yet heavy being—loses the body which forms her [frame]{box}, the compressed magical energy within it is released, which results in her Lifescale expanding (though this is actually just a false impression).
Though Arcueid’s consciousness is in the center of this light, as she no longer possesses a body to serve as a wall, she takes a state where her surplus magical energy levels remain, while the sort of self-image she imagines for herself is projected and dispersed. The Association calls this a Spiritron Frame (Lightframe). In other words, this is a natural phenomenon created out of nothing but mental power.
If one carelessly destroys a True Ancestor who still has magical energy in surplus, the energy stored within their body manifests—a retribution mechanism—and they become a calamity that destroys human cities.

Arcueid does not cause Inflation when Roa still has part of her power and she’s about to die in her weakened state, but with her having killed Roa in Ciel Route, her love toward Shiki causes her to bug out—unable to keep suppressing her vampiric urges, she brings about this phenomenon. Correction: she unintentionally brings about this phenomenon.
Luminary Arcueid is about 200 meters when she’s emerging, and about 100 when she’s stabilized her dispersed consciousness and is in her normal state.

#### — Mystic Eyes (Hyper Wide-Range)

All intelligent beings who Luminary Arc look at will have their minds paralyzed, either out of fear, or out of worship.
Unless those seen by Luminary Arc have unusually powerful mental strength, both escaping and fighting is infeasible.

#### — Fantasy Dequantification (Nullification of Normal Attacks)

Because of being in a mental form, only attacks which Arcueid recognizes as ‘oh, this one will suck’ are capable of wounding her.
In addition, being in an energy form means all injuries she receives are instantly restored to normal.

#### — Geothermal Manipulation & Atmospheric Manipulation

To change the surrounding environment into a harsh one.
The ground going into high-temperatures alone is enough to impede the activity of life, with all that approaches at the mercy of the atmospheric turbulence, as though a leaf in the wind—in short, she’s a personification of natural disasters.
An existence which is earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis, and the likes, all put together.
Princess Arc from Melty used all these consciously and intentionally, while Luminary Arc can only ever use them unconsciously and reactionarily.
They are only activating automatically as biological functions, and cannot be controlled.
Princess Arc is actually the one who is the superior of the two, given that she can properly use these disasters as weapons, and is able to keep damages to a minimum.
The Luminary is not a form meant for attacking, but for regeneration.
It is nothing more than a necessary procedure for recreating the body of the True Ancestor so they will once again be able to act out their role as one. Therefore, it’s unable to move from the spot where it manifested, no matter what (as there is no need to).
It’s sort of like the cores and surface-level synchrotron radiation quantity of stars.
The convergence of hydrogen and helium through strong gravity leads to planets being pressed together into masses of resources, eventually forming a benign crust after they cool down, while a Luminary is meant to turn into a body after its convergence.
The benefit to having a body goes without saying: the establishment of an ego—a self. Remaining a Luminary means that her consciousness would eventually merge with the Earth itself and then disperse as mere energy.
→ However, in Ciel Route, as Arc couldn’t control her reason/emotions, she also couldn’t cancel her Luminary. The only thing awaiting her at the end of that would be to perish from dispersal.
→ In addition, once she started walking out of jealousy, she gave up on being a chrysalis. Though the Luminary is ultimately a system meant for returning her to normal, once it is employed as an individual lifeform, even Arcueid will start falling apart at the seams, and eventually completely perish.
→ On the other hand… if one was to use the Luminary as a means of birthing a new, stronger individual instead of as a means of returning it to normal, then this would not apply. It would be able to act as a new True Ancestor, while the Arcueid of before would then quite literally disappear.
