The peculiar ability possessed by Shiki, our protagonist. Categorized as a psychic ability.
He can see the normally imperceivable “lines of death,” something akin to the point of collapse in all things.
These lines of death are like seams, which means all it takes to sever an object is to run a blade through them.
The strength and hardness of the object does not enter the equation. No matter how hard or frail, the feeling is always the same. Perceivable = Cuttable.
In addition, as things dismembered by the lines of death “kills” that specific part, healing is impossible. This is because the severed part has died on the existential level, even if it only looks like it has been cut.

Shiki is a living being and thus he’s able to better understand the death of things that are alive, same as him—this is why he unconsciously perceives the lines of death on the living.
However, Shiki himself can stress his consciousness and overexert his eyeballs to visualize even the ordinarily incomprehensible lines of death on inanimate objects, and through this, he can perceive even the “death of space—or, death of existence,” as an ultimate locality. (Shiki’s brain is unable to withstand seeing the lines to this level)

In addition to the lines of death, there are the points of death, which are a grade above the lines.
If the lines of death can be likened to blood vessels, the points of death are hearts.
Those that have had their point of death pierced are killed in literally a single strike. Just as in the case with the “death of space,” Shiki has to overexert himself if he wants to be able to see them.

It’s important to note that while the lines of death exist in all things, there are differences in how distinct they are.
Putting it simply: the lines of death are lifespan.
He can easily perceive the death of humans who only have the lifespan of about fifty to a hundred years, but it is difficult for him to perceive the death of existences who possess a lifespan in the hundreds or thousands of years.
Meaning, as long as he is trying to perceive the concept of death as a shape, he cannot quite so readily grasp it coming from things that are difficult to kill.
This is why when Shiki is up against Superior Dead Apostles{{n1}} or Arcueid in the story, he has to push his consciousness to the limit if he wants to perceive their death.

(*Superior Dead Apostles are hard to kill, while Arcueid cannot die. Shiki’s murder of Arcueid in the beginning of the game made the impossible possible. In the Tsukihime world, that Arcueid would die or be killed is something very much out of the norm)
